					        <p>To enhance and complement the literature curriculum in the classrooms, the library supports many programs to challenge and nurture eager readers. Led by Cathedral&rsquo;s librarian, Cindy Glenn, Cathedral fields two Battle of the Books (BOB) teams every year: one comprised of Middle School students and one of Fourth and Fifth Graders. BOB is made possible with funds from Cathedral&rsquo;s Run 4 Cathedral annual fundraiser.</p>

					        <p>Cathedral bases its program on the model by the Oregon Association of School Libraries. Cathedral&rsquo;s teams compete against teams from other Catholic schools in two battles in the spring. The battles consist of quiz-show type questions challenging children&rsquo;s knowledge of content on sixteen selected books. All children in the selected grades are eligible for the team and to qualify, must read eight of the sixteen books and demonstrate proficiency by passing a quiz on the Accelerated Reader Program or filling out an assessment form about the books. Practices for the team are led by Mrs. Glenn at lunchtime and before school in the months leading up to the Battles. The mission of the Battle of the Books program is to encourage and recognize students who enjoy reading, promote academic excellence, and foster cooperative learning and teamwork among students.</p>

								<h4>Overview</h4>
						        <p>Taking advantage of its proximity to the main Multnomah County library, Cathedral has formed a relationship with the children&rsquo;s librarians of the Multnomah County Library to complement our own curriculum with the activities and programs available with the public library.</p>
						        </div>
							<div class="noShowLibText" id="lunchBunch">
								<h4>Lunch Bunch</h4>
									<p>Cathedral&rsquo;s own librarian, Mrs. Glenn, has partnered with Multnomah County librarians to run voluntary book club style &ldquo;Lunch Bunches.&rdquo; Beginning in Grade Four, each month, children who sign up for Lunch Bunch read a book from a list compiled by the Multnomah County Librarian. Students bring their lunch and participate in a discussion led by Mrs. Glenn. The program highlights current award-winning children&rsquo;s books and challenges children in reading comprehension and analysis skills. Participating children enjoy reading a variety of books, including many that they would not typically select on their own.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="noShowLibText" id="LibraryCards">
								<h4>Library Card Sign-Ups</h4>
									<p>Every year, Cathedral&rsquo;s kindergarten class participates in the Great Library Card Adventure, the Library&rsquo;rs annual campaign to sign up school children for library cards. With all of our students enjoying their own Multnomah County library card, the full use of the programs available at the Library is ensured. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="noShowLibText "id="BannedBooks">
								<h4>Banned Book Week</h4>
									<p>Designed to coincide with Banned Book Week in late September, Cathedral School Seventh Graders are treated to a presentation from a county librarian that includes an overview of issues of censorship and an introduction to a variety of banned and challenged books. Banned Book Week celebrates the freedom to read and the presentation helps children value free and open access to information in the library.</p></div>
						        <div class="noShowLibText" id="SummerReading">
						        <h4>Summer Reading Program</h4>
						        	<p>As Cathedral students prepare for summer and set goals for summer reading, Multnomah County public librarians again visit our students to share information about and preregister all students for its annual Summer Reading Program. The librarians feature books being published during the summer to create excitement for the coming months of reading.  Cathedral Students have volunteered at Multnomah County Libraries during the summer to help administer these programs and encourage fellow young readers.</p>

					        <p>The Cathedral Library Birthday Book Program offers parents, grandparents, and friends the opportunity to provide a lasting tribute to celebrate student birthdays. An $18 donation funds the purchase of a library book that has been selected with the honoree in mind. This book will be tailored to both the interests and reading level of the birthday celebrant, and will be presented during the student&rsquo;s class. The celebrant will then have the honor of being the first student to check it out from the library. </p>
					        <p>To participate in the program, use the online form to submit or print and complete the Birthday Book form, and return it, along with the $18 donation, to the school office.</p>

					        <p>The Beverly Cleary Children&rsquo;s Choice Award is sponsored by the Oregon Association of School Libraries and is named in honor of Beverly Cleary, the beloved Oregon-born children&rsquo;s book author. The award is to encourage reading by highlighting good quality literature written on the second and third grade reading level. The contest encourages reading books that students may not otherwise find on their own and are not necessarily the popular best sellers. Cathedral&rsquo;s Second and Third Graders are encouraged to read at least four books from the list of nominated books and then are eligible to vote for their own choice. Mrs. Glenn then submits the votes on behalf of Cathedral&rsquo;s students and shares the winner once it is announced. </p>

					        <p>The Oregon Readers&rsquo;  Choice Award is co-sponsored by the Oregon Library Association along with the Oregon Reading Association and the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association. Targeted at children in Fourth Grade through high school, ORCA has two categories that Cathedral Students participate in: upper elementary school division and middle school (intermediate) division. ORCA is intended to be a fun and exciting way for young readers to become enthusiastic and discriminating readers by reading a variety of books and then voting for their favorites in a democratic process. Cathedral students in grades four through eight are eligible to vote once they have read at least four of the books from the list of nominees.</p>
