        <h3>Welcome to Cathedral School</h3>
        <p class="welcomeText">Fall at Cathedral School brings new beginnings, as well as a
          time to celebrate our past successes. This fall, in addition to
          250 bright-eyed students, we have classroom furniture upgrades,
          a new Religion curriculum for Pre-Kindergarten through eighth
          grade, and have been named an Apple Distinguished School for
          2013-2015. Cathedral School joins less than 140 schools that
          Apple is recognizing nationwide as exemplary learning
          environments and centers of innovation, leadership, and
          educational excellence. The Apple Distinguished School
          designation is reserved for schools that have demonstrated
          Apple's highest vision of a successful 21st century learning
          environment. The selection of Cathedral School as an Apple
          Distinguished School highlights our successes in enhancing and
          extending teaching and learning with thoughtful and innovative
          implementations of technology.<br><br>
          Schools nominated by Apple for designation as an Apple
          Distinguished School must demonstrate Apple's highest vision of
          a successful 21st century learning environment, a strong
          relationship with Apple, and a willingness to do outreach
          activities. The specific manifestations of these qualities
          include</p>
          <ul id="appleList">
            <li>Visionary Leadership</li>
            <li>One-to-one access to Apple portable computers and/or
              mobile devices for all students, teachers and
              administrators</li>
            <li>Ongoing professional development</li>
            <li>Systems to routinely collect quantitative evidence
              highlighting the success and sustainability of their academic
              programs.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <p>We have a busy year ahead and I feel so fortunate to have a
          collaborative team on board to help provide the very best
          Catholic education for your children. We value your participation
          as parents, parishioners, alumni, and donors, and are grateful
          for your support.<br>Thank you to the staff, parents, and students of Cathedral
          School. It is because of the tremendous talent we have on staff,
          the quality and character of our students and parents that
          Cathedral School was able to receive this distinction.</p>

          <h3>PreKindergarten Program</h3>
          <p>A ten-year journey of faith, knowledge, and service begins
          in Cathedral&rsquo;s Pre-Kindergarten. Pre-K establishes a
          solid foundation that will lead to a positive educational
          experience for years to come. The goal is to create a
          respectful, responsible, and safe classroom and school
          environment where all students can learn and play together as
          followers of Jesus.<br>
          In the Pre-K class, God blesses the children with the gift
          of time&#58; time to learn, time to play, and time to grow. The day
          is tailored to excite the seeds of knowledge in the children
          and carefully crafted to nurture the gifts and talents that
          each child possesses. Beginning literary and mathematics skills
          are cultivated through engaging projects done both individually
          and in groups and children are introduced to science, art,
          music, and Spanish programs through fun interactive
          experiences. Finally, these individual children are brought
          together to form a community. Through prayer and play, laughter
          and sharing, they (along with their parents) create friendships
          to carry them through their years at Cathedral.</p>

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>For our youngest students, service begins with an understanding of fellow students as children of God, who deserve respect and compassion. Students are acknowledged and rewarded for everyday acts of service to fellow classmates and teachers. Within the greater school community, the Pre-K students are introduced to and come to understand the variety of service projects organized by higher grades through their active participation in the collection and donation of food and other needed items for charitable organizations throughout the community.</p>

          <h3>Kindergarten Program</h3>
          <p>God&rsquo;s creation and the appreciation of each child as a
          unique and special part of His Creation form the basis for
          every aspect of a Kindergartener&rsquo;s day. Children learn to
          pray and participate in prayer in many forms: as a class, with
          their 8 th Grade buddies, and as individuals. Kindergarteners
          begin to learn to look beyond themselves (and toward others in
          God&rsquo;s creation) by serving children both in daily
          interactions within their classroom as well as community
          projects focusing on homeless children.</p>
          <p>As the kindergarteners leap into an all-day learning
          environment, the foundation for future academic success begins
          with a focus on the routine and expectations of a typical
          school day and by instilling a sense of personal responsibility
          to carry students through their academic career. The
          fundamentals of literacy and mathematical skills are developed
          through varied methods including whole group, small group, and
          one-on-one; allowing individual students to learn and grow at
          their own pace. All the while, Cathedral&rsquo;s kindergarten
          is a fun-filled learning space where smiles and giggles abound
          as children develop new friendships through play and
          cooperative learning.</p>

          <h3>First Grade Program</h3>
          <p>In First Grade, children learn that they are all part of one family, God&rsquo;s family.  The Golden Rule is paramount in behavioral management and peer relations.  THe basics of Catholicism are taught and throughout the year, a commitment to service&#58; to parish, school and community, is cultivated.<br><br>
            First Grade builds a firm and broad foundation of literacy proficiency in Cathedral Students.  Students&rsquo; reading and writing skills are individually developed and fostered within a backdrop of different thematic curricula that engage the children throughout the year. First Grade recognizes and appreciates the uniqueness of each six and seven-year-old in the class as they make the transition to a more structured academic environment and seeks to instill a sense of personal responsibility while nurturing each child&rsquo;s love of learning.

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>In First Grade, service takes form in an age&#45;appropriate
            manner to instill a sense of commitment in everyday actions by
            helping others. First Graders serve the parish through monthly
            church clean up activities. While tidying the pews and picking
            up trash, the children are also instructed on the architecture,
            history, and religious art within the sanctuary. Children in
            First Grade serve the community along with their Fourth Grade
            Reading Buddies by gathering and assembling Easter Baskets of
            stuffed animals and candy for Cares NW, a local agency that
            strives to prevent child abuse and neglect.</p>

          <h3>Second Grade Program</h3>
          <p>Preparation for the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy
          Eucharist are the centerpiece of Second Grade at Cathedral
          School. Together with St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral&rsquo;s pastor
          and Cathedral&rsquo;s principal, the second grade teacher
          guides the students and their families on a year&ndash;long
          journey of faith as the children become more fully initiated
          Catholics.<br><br>
          Second Grade challenges its students to think on a deeper
          level as readers transition from learning to read, to reading
          to learn. Writing skills are strengthened as these young
          authors begin to understand the process of crafting a piece of
          writing and the different forms it may take. This enhanced
          level of reflection spills over into mathematics where
          increasingly complex strategies are coupled with tasks that
          require students to write to explain the steps employed in
          problem solving. Throughout the year, new friendships are
          formed and existing ones strengthened in an atmosphere of
          respect, compassion, and fun both in the classroom and on the
          playground.</p>

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>Together with their Sixth Grade buddies, the Second Grade
            organizes and runs &#34;Mac Attack,&#34; a macaroni and cheese
            drive for the Sunshine Division of the Portland Police Bureau.
            Collecting boxes of macaroni and cheese, Mac Attack helps
            children in need of food throughout Portland. The Second and
            Sixth Graders decorate boxes, make signs, and publicize the
            event to the school. The drive is in May, right after First
            Communion, and provides a fun and spirited way for Second
            Graders to put faith into service in a tangible and productive
            way.</p>
            <p>Just like in First Grade, the Second Graders continue to
            serve the parish through monthly church clean up sessions. As
            they prepare for the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy
            Eucharist, time in the sanctuary is an opportunity to begin to
            understand the purpose and symbolism of the many holy objects
            within the church that relate to the sacraments.</p>
