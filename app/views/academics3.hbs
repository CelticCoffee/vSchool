                time to celebrate our past successes. This fall, in addition to
                250 bright-eyed students, we have classroom furniture upgrades,
                a new Religion curriculum for Pre-Kindergarten through eighth
                grade, and have been named an Apple Distinguished School for
                2013-2015. Cathedral School joins less than 140 schools that
                Apple is recognizing nationwide as exemplary learning
                environments and centers of innovation, leadership, and
                educational excellence. The Apple Distinguished School
                designation is reserved for schools that have demonstrated
                Apple's highest vision of a successful 21st century learning
                environment. The selection of Cathedral School as an Apple
                Distinguished School highlights our successes in enhancing and
                extending teaching and learning with thoughtful and innovative
                implementations of technology.<br><br>
                Schools nominated by Apple for designation as an Apple
                Distinguished School must demonstrate Apple's highest vision of
                a successful 21st century learning environment, a strong
                relationship with Apple, and a willingness to do outreach
                activities. The specific manifestations of these qualities

              <h3>Program</h3>
              <p>A ten-year journey of faith, knowledge, and service begins
              in Cathedral&rsquo;s Pre-Kindergarten. Pre-K establishes a
              solid foundation that will lead to a positive educational
              experience for years to come. The goal is to create a
              respectful, responsible, and safe classroom and school
              environment where all students can learn and play together as
              followers of Jesus.<br>
              In the Pre-K class, God blesses the children with the gift
              of time&#58; time to learn, time to play, and time to grow. The day
              is tailored to excite the seeds of knowledge in the children
              and carefully crafted to nurture the gifts and talents that
              each child possesses. Beginning literary and mathematics skills
              are cultivated through engaging projects done both individually
              and in groups and children are introduced to science, art,
              music, and Spanish programs through fun interactive
              experiences. Finally, these individual children are brought
              together to form a community. Through prayer and play, laughter
              and sharing, they (along with their parents) create friendships
              to carry them through their years at Cathedral.</p>
              <h3>Service</h3>
              <p>For our youngest students, service begins with an understanding of fellow students as children of God, who deserve respect and compassion. Students are acknowledged and rewarded for everyday acts of service to fellow classmates and teachers. Within the greater school community, the Pre-K students are introduced to and come to understand the variety of service projects organized by higher grades through their active participation in the collection and donation of food and other needed items for charitable organizations throughout the community.</p>

                <h3>Program</h3>
                <p>God&rsquo;s creation and the appreciation of each child as a
                unique and special part of His Creation form the basis for
                every aspect of a Kindergartener&rsquo;s day. Children learn to
                pray and participate in prayer in many forms: as a class, with
                their 8 th Grade buddies, and as individuals. Kindergarteners
                begin to learn to look beyond themselves (and toward others in
                God&rsquo;s creation) by serving children both in daily
                interactions within their classroom as well as community
                projects focusing on homeless children.</p>
                <p>As the kindergarteners leap into an all-day learning
                environment, the foundation for future academic success begins
                with a focus on the routine and expectations of a typical
                school day and by instilling a sense of personal responsibility
                to carry students through their academic career. The
                fundamentals of literacy and mathematical skills are developed
                through varied methods including whole group, small group, and
                one-on-one; allowing individual students to learn and grow at
                their own pace. All the while, Cathedral&rsquo;s kindergarten
                is a fun-filled learning space where smiles and giggles abound
                as children develop new friendships through play and
                cooperative learning.</p>
                <h3>Service</h3>
                <p>As service is an attribute often best cultivated by example,
                kindergarteners work side&#45;by&#45;side with their 8th Grade
                Buddies on the annual Cathedral school&#45;wide sock project
                that benefits Potluck in the Park. The kindergarten class
                then&#45;on its own--decorates and fills sacks with toys,
                candy, hats, and gloves for the children served by the Potluck
                in the Park program.</p>

                <h3>Program</h3>
                <p>In First Grade, children learn that they are all part of one
                family, God&rsquo;s Family. The Golden Rule is paramount in
                behavioral management and peer relations. The basics of
                Catholicism are taught and throughout the year, a commitment to
                service&#45;to parish, school, and community&#45;is
                cultivated.</p>
                <p>First Grade builds a firm and broad foundation of literacy
                proficiency in Cathedral Students. Students&rsquo; reading and
                writing skills are individually developed and fostered within a
                backdrop of different thematic curricula that engage the
                children throughout the year. First Grade recognizes and
                appreciates the uniqueness of each six- and
                seven&#45;year&#45;old in the class as they make the transition
                to a more structured academic environment and seeks to instill
                a sense of personal responsibility while nurturing each
                child&rsquo;s love of learning.</p>
                <h3>Service</h3>
                <p>In First Grade, service takes form in an age&#45;appropriate
                manner to instill a sense of commitment in everyday actions by
                helping others. First Graders serve the parish through monthly
                church clean up activities. While tidying the pews and picking
                up trash, the children are also instructed on the architecture,
                history, and religious art within the sanctuary. Children in
                First Grade serve the community along with their Fourth Grade
                Reading Buddies by gathering and assembling Easter Baskets of
                stuffed animals and candy for Cares NW, a local agency that
                strives to prevent child abuse and neglect.</p>

              <p>Preparation for the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy
              Eucharist are the centerpiece of Second Grade at Cathedral
              School. Together with St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral&rsquo;s pastor
              and Cathedral&rsquo;s principal, the second grade teacher
              guides the students and their families on a year&ndash;long
              journey of faith as the children become more fully initiated
              Catholics.</p>
              <p>Second Grade challenges its students to think on a deeper
              level as readers transition from learning to read, to reading
              to learn. Writing skills are strengthened as these young
              authors begin to understand the process of crafting a piece of
              writing and the different forms it may take. This enhanced
              level of reflection spills over into mathematics where
              increasingly complex strategies are coupled with tasks that
              require students to write to explain the steps employed in
              problem solving. Throughout the year, new friendships are
              formed and existing ones strengthened in an atmosphere of
              respect, compassion, and fun both in the classroom and on the
              playground.</p>
              <h3>Service</h3>
              <p>Together with their Sixth Grade buddies, the Second Grade
              organizes and runs &#34;Mac Attack,&#34; a macaroni and cheese
              drive for the Sunshine Division of the Portland Police Bureau.
              Collecting boxes of macaroni and cheese, Mac Attack helps
              children in need of food throughout Portland. The Second and
              Sixth Graders decorate boxes, make signs, and publicize the
              event to the school. The drive is in May, right after First
              Communion, and provides a fun and spirited way for Second
              Graders to put faith into service in a tangible and productive
              way.</p>
              <p>Just like in First Grade, the Second Graders continue to
              serve the parish through monthly church clean up sessions. As
              they prepare for the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy
              Eucharist, time in the sanctuary is an opportunity to begin to
              understand the purpose and symbolism of the many holy objects
              within the church that relate to the sacraments.</p>

          <h3>Program</h3>
          <p>Learning to pray in many ways&ndash;in the classroom, at
          mass, and on one&rsquo;s own&ndash;and understanding the
          purpose, meaning, and symbolism of the many forms of Catholic
          prayer is the focus of Third Grade. The Third Grade lives out
          its faith through its commitment to serving the remarkable
          children at Providence&rsquo;s Center for Medically Fragile
          Children.</p>
          <p>Third grade is a transitional year in student learning. As
          reading skills are mastered, children move from basic
          competence to a greater level of reading comprehension,
          fostering the creation of independent readers and thinkers. In
          mathematics, students become proficient in multiplication and
          division skills setting a strong foundation in basic math facts
          to allow for future growth. The joy of learning is evident in
          the Third Grade classroom where enthusiasm for academic success
          and a healthy amount of fun come together for a full and active
          school day.</p>
          <h3>Service</h3>
          <p>For many years, Cathedral&rsquo;s third graders have served
          Providence&rsquo;s Center for Medically Fragile Children, a
          pediatric skilled nursing facility. For many children and
          volunteer parents, this experience is transformative. Cathedral
          students visit and play with children at the center with a
          backdrop of faith—beginning and ending each volunteer session
          in prayer. Students take away from their sessions an
          understanding of all children as creations of God, an
          appreciation of the value of every person, thanksgiving for
          one’s personal health, and a greater self-awareness of their
          ability to be comfortable with children different from
          themselves. These lessons extend beyond the Providence
          volunteer times and make Third Grade time a time of great
          personal growth and maturity.</p>
          <p>Back in the parish, Third Graders continue to serve St.
          Mary’s Cathedral through church clean up which couples service
          with religious education through a behind the scenes
          understanding of the sanctuary as a place of worship.</p>

          <h3>Program</h3>
          <p>Fourth Graders take a step up literally and academically at
          Cathedral. As these students move to the upper floor of our
          school building, the Fourth Grade curriculum becomes more
          complex and organization and personal responsibility for
          completion of schoolwork is instilled in the students. As
          citizens of Oregon, Fourth Graders focus on Oregon&rsquo;s
          geography, history, and political structure. Carefully planned
          field trips throughout the state to significant sites are
          capped off with an overnight camp-out at the Oregon Trail where
          students learn first&ndash;hand how the state&rsquo;s pioneers
          first lived.</p>
          <p>An understanding of living as a person of Christ is made
          manifest through an in&ndash;depth study of the lives of saints
          where the Fourth Graders educate the whole school on a
          personally selected saint. The Fourth Grade core curriculum
          builds on knowledge gained in earlier grades and moves students
          into an increasingly comprehensive and rigorous academic study,
          all the while assessing each child&rsquo;s abilities and
          crafting individual goals for mathematics, reading, and writing
          personally designed for every child to thrive.</p>
          <h3>Service</h3>
          <p>In Fourth Grade, students begin to focus on the needs of
          fellow citizens of Oregon and donate time throughout the year
          at the Oregon Food Bank. Students and volunteer parents work
          together in groups to gather, assemble, and package food for
          needy families throughout the State. At the end of each
          volunteer session, the impact of the task is made clear through
          calculations that tell children how many meals will be prepared
          and families that will be fed by their efforts.</p>
          <p>Within the school building, Fourth Graders have&#45;for the
          first time as Cathedral students&#45;a buddy who is younger:
          every Fourth Grader is matched with a Pre-Kindergarten student.
          Together these pairs attend mass, complete special seasonal
          projects, and participate together in all school events where
          the youngest Cathedral students need a helping hand. Through
          this interaction, compassion, understanding, and empathy are
          fostered while the fourth graders relish the companionship of
          an eager, admiring four-year-old student. .</p>

          <h3>Program</h3>
          <p>Building on their firm understanding of the basic tenets of
          Catholicism, Fifth Graders begin to appreciate their faith on a
          personal level. Through a study of the Old and New Testaments,
          along with the lives of the saints, Fifth Graders start to know
          what it means to be an active member of the Catholic Church and
          how, as Catholics, they are called to a vocation of
          service.</p>
          <p>Fifth Grade marks the final year in Cathedral&rsquo;s
          elementary grades before the transition to its middle school.
          Fifth Grade students are tasked with an enhanced personal
          responsibility for their schoolwork and homework, and classroom
          expectations reflect an appreciation of the increasing
          potential of maturing students. As confident and thoughtful
          readers, Fifth Graders read and analyze texts from varied
          genres to promote both critical thinking skills and independent
          thought. In mathematics, students solidify their calculation
          and computation skills and broaden problem&ndash;solving skills
          to include the study of beginning geometry and algebra. A broad
          range of topics in science and social science engage the
          inquisitive minds and tap into a student&rsquo;s natural
          curiosity of the world around them.</p>
          <h3>Service</h3>
          <p>To carry out their call to service, Fifth Graders organize
          and administer the annual Thanksgiving Food Drive that benefits
          Lift Urban Portland, an interfaith network of volunteers that
          work to meet the needs of residents of Northwest and downtown
          Portland. With Cathedral School&rsquo;s location in Northwest
          Portland, students are keenly aware of those in need, as they
          are our school’s neighbors. The Fifth Grade’s efforts rally
          support for donations throughout the school that go to supply
          Lift Urban&rsquo;s food pantry and fill backpacks of nutritious
          food for children who attend the neighborhood public
          school.</p>

      <h2>Fifth Grade</h2>
      <p>Building on their firm understanding of the basic tenets of
      Catholicism, Fifth Graders begin to appreciate their faith on a
      personal level. Through a study of the Old and New Testaments,
      along with the lives of the saints, Fifth Graders start to know
      what it means to be an active member of the Catholic Church and
      how, as Catholics, they are called to a vocation of service.</p>
      <p>Fifth Grade marks the final year in Cathedral&rsquo;s elementary
      grades before the transition to its middle school. Fifth Grade
      students are tasked with an enhanced personal responsibility for
      their schoolwork and homework, and classroom expectations reflect
      an appreciation of the increasing potential of maturing students.
      As confident and thoughtful readers, Fifth Graders read and analyze
      texts from varied genres to promote both critical thinking skills
      and independent thought. In mathematics, students solidify their
      calculation and computation skills and broaden
      problem&ndash;solving skills to include the study of beginning
      geometry and algebra. A broad range of topics in science and social
      science engage the inquisitive minds and tap into a student&rsquo;s
      natural curiosity of the world around them.</p>
