  			<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
  			<img src="img/img_about/DSC_0404.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="kids in chapel">
  			<h4>Our Vision</h4>
  			<p>Cathedral School is a premier comprehensive Catholic School with strong emphasis on faith, knowledge, service and community.	</p>
  			<h4>Mission</h4>
  			<p>The mission of Cathedral School is to provide an excellent academic education grounded in Catholic religious principles and values, thereby creating a life-long love for learning and respect for each person and all creation as gifts of God.</p>
  			<h4>Cathedral School will:</h4>
  			<p>Create a faith community wherein Catholic truths become the foundation for daily living in a global community.</p>
  			<p>Design and implement curricula that provide for the education of the whole person.</p>
			<p>Provide a learning environment in which all children may grow toward their fullest God- given potential.</p>
			<p>Foster the physical, emotional, and social well being of each individual.  Complement and support parents in their role as the primary educators of their children.</p>
			<p>Students are taught to assimilate academic and life skills, as well as social attitudes, which will assist them to internalize Catholic values in their discovery of truth. They are guided toward excellence as contributing and effective members of society.</p>
			<p>The school is a living encounter with cultural and Catholic heritage. While honoring our parents as primary educators of their children, Cathedral School seeks to nurture the formation of the individual student. As facilitators of learning, teachers encourage the development of critically thinking students who are responsible and self-disciplined and who take pride in being part of Cathedral and the global community.</p>

These friendships are important to both students and long-lasting. Buddy grades are paired as follows: PK & 4th, K & 8th, 1st & 5th, 2nd & 6th, and 3rd & 7th.</p>
