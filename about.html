  			<h4>Our Vision</h4>
  			<p>Cathedral School is a premier comprehensive Catholic School with strong emphasis on faith, knowledge, service and community.	</p>
  			<h4>Mission</h4>
  			<p>The mission of Cathedral School is to provide an excellent academic education grounded in Catholic religious principles and values, thereby creating a life-long love for learning and respect for each person and all creation as gifts of God.</p>
  			<h4>Cathedral School will:</h4>
  			<p>Create a faith community wherein Catholic truths become the foundation for daily living in a global community.</p>
  			<p>Design and implement curricula that provide for the education of the whole person.</p>
			<p>Provide a learning environment in which all children may grow toward their fullest God- given potential.</p>
			<p>Foster the physical, emotional, and social well being of each individual.  Complement and support parents in their role as the primary educators of their children.</p>
			<p>Students are taught to assimilate academic and life skills, as well as social attitudes, which will assist them to internalize Catholic values in their discovery of truth. They are guided toward excellence as contributing and effective members of society.</p>
			<p>The school is a living encounter with cultural and Catholic heritage. While honoring our parents as primary educators of their children, Cathedral School seeks to nurture the formation of the individual student. As facilitators of learning, teachers encourage the development of critically thinking students who are responsible and self-disciplined and who take pride in being part of Cathedral and the global community.</p>

			<h3>Cathedral School History</h3>
			<img src="img/img_about/stainedGlass.jpeg" class="img-responsive" alt="stained glass window">
			<p>Cathedral School has served the Portland area for over 100 years. Archbishop William Gross established Cathedral School, originally known as St. Mary's Parochial School, in 1896. In 1900 the school was named St. Mary's Academy Annex. It was operated by the Sisters of the Holy Names at N.W. 16th and Everett.</p>
			<p>At the time, there were 15 students enrolled in grades K-4. Beginning with the 1910-11 school year, it became known as Cathedral School. Four years later, Cathedral Parish pastor, Father Edwin O'Hara approved the building of what is now the Cathedral complex along N.W. 17th Street. This building was the site of Cathedral School for 48 years.</p>
			<p>The school's location did not change until 1961 when the Dunne family donated their home property to Cathedral Parish for construction of the present Cathedral School. From as far back as 1910, enrollment was 179 students and reached an all-time high of 295 students in 1964. Enrollment then declined due to the changing nature of the neighborhood. This led to changes in acceptance policy during the 1970s that encouraged broader geographic and ethnic representation of students.</p>
			<p>Since its founding, Cathedral School has evolved from a parish school to a school that draws students from the Portland tri-county area as well as Clark County in Washington. While many changes have taken place, the school's values of diversity, respect, reverence for others and belief in God have remained constant through its "Century of Excellence in Education."</p>

			<h5>Do you offer foreign language?  What other specialists?</h5>

			<h5>Do the students attend Mass together?</h5>
				<p>Cathedral students attend Mass as a school in the Cathedral on Wednesdays, at least twice per month. On the alternate Wednesdays students gather in the gym for POW (Prayer on Wednesday). Mass and POW services are planned by students. Mass begins at 8:30, while POW begins at 8:20.</p>

Among our most important service projects are a fall food drive, stuffing socks with toiletries and snacks for distribution at the Potluck in the Park Christmas dinner, and raising funds for our sister school, St. Vincent de Paul in Salem, Oregon.</p>
				<p>In addition to celebrating Mass with the school, our parish priests visit in our classrooms as their schedules allow. Maintaining a strong school-parish bond is achieved through these visits and other events and activities.</p>
				<p>All students at Cathedral are paired with a "buddy" from another grade. They sit together at Mass, have joint classroom activities, and occasionally attend field trips together. These friendships are important to both students and long-lasting. Buddy grades are paired as follows: PK & 4th, K & 8th, 1st & 5th, 2nd & 6th, and 3rd & 7th.</p>
