			        <p>Music education at Cathedral takes many forms. Drawing inspiration and direction from both the
			        Kod&aacutely Method and Orff Approach, the curriculum engages the minds and bodies of students.  From traditional religious and folk music vocal selections to contemporary songs, children learn the basics of music education with concepts of rhythm, beat, melody, tempo, and dynamics. Vocal training is coupled with instrument play at each grade with a range of pitched and non-pitched percussion instruments from triangles, drums and tambourines to glockenspiels and boomwhackers. Beginning in Grade 4, all students learn the recorder. In the youngest grades, movement and music come together with the help of parachutes, scarves, hula-hoops, and balls.  At its essence, class time is focused on instilling an appreciation of the beauty, art, and joy of music in its many forms.</p>
			        <p>Music classes are closely tied with liturgical preparation. Each class is tasked with preparing and leading the school in prayer services (Prayer on Wednesday) and masses during the school year.  During music class, students select and rehearse music for the liturgies. Children in grades two through eight interested in furthering their music training and performance can participate in the Cathedral Children&rsquo;s Choir that performs at school masses and monthly parish family masses. All Cathedral students participate in the annual Christmas Program held in St.
			        Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral where individual classes as well as all students together present Christmas selections culminating in a reenactment of the gospel story of Christmas complete with choral accompaniment.</p>

		        		<li><h4>Choir</h4>
		        			<p>
		        			Open to all children in grades two through eight, the Cathedral Children&rsquo;s Choir provides additional opportunities for vocal instruction and performance for students beyond the school day music instruction. Children practice afterschool and perform both at bi-monthly school masses as well as the monthly Parish Family Masses. As students advance, they are trained and perform as cantors at these masses as well. The choir focuses on liturgical music but blends popular music into instruction to keep the experience fun and engaging for the participants.</p></li>
		        		<li><h4>Strings</h4>
		        			<p>
		        			Cathedral School is excited to offer a new strings class beginning fall 2015.  Open to all ages, the class meets immediately after school on a weekly basis.  A variety of styles of music will be covered with an emphasis on teamwork, musicality and artistic expression.  The class will culminate with a performance at the annual Christmas Concert.</p></li>

		        	<p>Physical fitness, sportsmanship, and athletic skill all come together in the physical education program at Cathedral.  Throughout the year, students learn and participate in a variety of different team sports with the goal of exposing students to sports they may pursue outside of school and fostering teamwork and cooperation between classmates.  Students are also encouraged on an individual level through FitnessGram, an educational tool to determine students&rsquo; overall physical fitness and suggest areas for improvement when appropriate.  All the while, PE is a time where the fun of sport is celebrated and encouraged.  On the playground, sports education blends with recreation and play when the PE Teacher supervises (and referees) recess play.  At Cathedral, all students are athletes and student achievement in physical education is measured based on effort, participation, skill growth, cooperation, and most importantly, sportsmanship.

		        	<p>Cathedral maintains a collaborative partnership with the Oregon College of Art and Craft that supplies a skilled teacher to run our art program. Miss  Cynthia Trevi&ntilde;o was engaged as our art teacher in the fall of 2015. Prior to joining Cathedral she taught at OCAC in their summer camp program. Her previous experience includes teaching art in an elementary school for six years as well as working with students from the age of four to fifteen in outside programs. Beside her experience in drawing, painting, ceramics, photography and printmaking, she is also fluent in Spanish. In 2008 she was awarded teacher of the year at Gillette Elementary and has exhibited her artwork publicly. </p>
		        	<p>In all grades, drawing and painting instruction are combined with opportunities to work three dimensionally with clay, papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;, and sculpey.  Notable artists (last year, Matisse, Van Gogh, Warhol, Mondrian, and Kushner) and works (like The Colosseum) inspire student work.</p>
		        	<p>Funds from Run 4 Cathedral and Cathedral&rsquo;s donors make Cathedral School&rsquo;s art program possible.</p>
	        	</div>
	        	<div id='artShowText'>
	        		Every first Thursday in May (to coincide with the Pearl District Art Gallery&rsquo;s First Thursday Program), the Cathedral community gathers to celebrate the students&rsquo; achievement in art during the school year.  Cathedral&rsquo;s gym is transformed into an art gallery where all students&rsquo; work is featured and displayed.  Parents, students, and friends of Cathedral are invited to stroll and linger in the gym-gallery.  The evening is topped off with a community building Spaghetti Dinner prepared by parents of Cathedral and served by our 7th Grade Students.

	        <p>Cathedral takes great pride in its library. In 2000, when a major expansion of the school was undertaken, putting in a state-of-the-art albeit traditional library was of paramount importance.  The school and generous donors have continued to invest in the library keeping it up-to-date and fully stocked with books and technology to be a great resource for all students and faculty and a place of calm for the children during busy school days. </p>
	        <p>Students in Pre-Kindergarten through Fifth Grade attend library two times per week. The librarian works in cooperation with the classroom teachers to engage the children in thoughtful curriculum that complements the focus of instruction in the classrooms. In addition, the librarian helps introduce and foster aptitude in research skills both with traditional paper resources in the library and online sources through guided direction on the proper and effective use of Internet research on iPads.</p>
	        <p>Children in Fourth through Eighth Grade have the opportunity to participate in a variety of programs (for example, Battle of the Books and Lunch Bunch) that complement the literature curriculum of the classroom, provide additional opportunities for independent reading for the voracious reader, and foster a sense of academic camaraderie through teamwork and competition.</p>

	        <p>Recognizing a well-rounded Catholic education includes exposure to the discipline of learning a world language, an appreciation of diverse cultures, and development of a connection between faith and language, all Cathedral students study Spanish. Children in Pre -Kindergarten through Fifth Grade attend Spanish two times per week, often in small groups. In Middle School, Spanish is part of the core curriculum and students are taught three times a week. The curriculum is tailored to each age group with each grade’s students progressively broadening their vocabulary and increasing the complexity of their language. Communicative language use is a focus at every grade level with the youngest students learning to reply to simple questions and the middle school students engaging in full-length improvised conversations. The middle school curriculum is designed to give students a solid base in Spanish level 1 and an introduction to Spanish level 2, so that students may test out of high school level 1 if they choose.  Students who opt to study a new language in high school are well prepared with the language learning skills they have attained. </p>
	        <p>Throughout the school year, the connection between the Catholic Church and Spanish-speaking countries is explored through celebrating an annual prayer service in Spanish, honoring religious holidays important in Hispanic communities (such as the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe), and the learning and reciting of Catholic prayers in Spanish.</p>
