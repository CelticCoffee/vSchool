	        <p>Music education at Cathedral takes many forms. Drawing inspiration and direction from both the 
	        Kod&aacutely Method and Orff Approach, the curriculum engages the minds and bodies of students.  From traditional religious and folk music vocal selections to contemporary songs, children learn the basics of music education with concepts of rhythm, beat, melody, tempo, and dynamics. Vocal training is coupled with instrument play at each grade with a range of pitched and non-pitched percussion instruments from triangles, drums and tambourines to glockenspiels and boomwhackers. Beginning in Grade 4, all students learn the recorder. In the youngest grades, movement and music come together with the help of parachutes, scarves, hula-hoops, and balls.  At its essence, class time is focused on instilling an appreciation of the beauty, art, and joy of music in its many forms.</p>
	        <p>Music classes are closely tied with liturgical preparation. Each class is tasked with preparing and leading the school in prayer services (Prayer on Wednesday) and masses during the school year.  During music class, students select and rehearse music for the liturgies. Children in grades two through eight interested in furthering their music training and performance can participate in the Cathedral Children&rsquo;s Choir that performs at school masses and monthly parish family masses. All Cathedral students participate in the annual Christmas Program held in St. 
	        Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral where individual classes as well as all students together present Christmas selections culminating in a reenactment of the gospel story of Christmas complete with choral accompaniment.</p>

	        	<p>
	        	Physical fitness, sportsmanship, and athletic skill all come together in the physical education program at Cathedral.  Throughout the year, students learn and participate in a variety of different team sports with the goal of exposing students to sports they may pursue outside of school and fostering teamwork and cooperation between classmates.  Students are also encouraged on an individual level through FitnessGram, an educational tool to determine studentsâ€™ overall physical fitness and suggest areas for improvement when appropriate.  All the while, PE is a time where the fun of sport is celebrated and encouraged.  On the playground, sports education blends with recreation and play when the PE Teacher supervises (and referees) recess play.  At Cathedral, all students are athletes and student achievement in physical education is measured based on effort, participation, skill growth, cooperation, and most importantly, sportsmanship.

	        	<p>Cathedral maintains a collaborative partnership with the Oregon College of Art and Craft that supplies a skilled teacher to run our art program. Miss  Cynthia Trevi&ntilde;o was engaged as our art teacher in the fall of 2015. Prior to joining Cathedral she taught at OCAC in their summer camp program. Her previous experience includes teaching art in an elementary school for six years as well as working with students from the age of four to fifteen in outside programs. Beside her experience in drawing, painting, ceramics, photography and printmaking, she is also fluent in Spanish. In 2008 she was awarded teacher of the year at Gillette Elementary and has exhibited her artwork publicly. </p>

	        <p>Cathedral takes great pride in its library. In 2000, when a major expansion of the school was undertaken, putting in a state-of-the-art albeit traditional library was of paramount importance.  The school and generous donors have continued to invest in the library keeping it up-to-date and fully stocked with books and technology to be a great resource for all students and faculty and a place of calm for the children during busy school days. </p>
