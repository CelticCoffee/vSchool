This fall, in addition to 250 bright-eyed students, we have classroom furniture upgrades, a new Religion curriculum for Pre-Kindergarten through eighth grade, and have been named an Apple Distinguished School for 2013-2015.
    							Cathedral School joins less than 140 schools that Apple is recognizing nationwide as exemplary learning environments and centers of innovation, leadership, and educational excellence. The Apple Distinguished School designation is reserved for schools that have demonstrated Apple's highest vision of a successful 21st century learning environment.

                  <p>A ten-year journey of faith, knowledge, and service begins in Cathedral&rsquo;s Pre-Kindergarten.  Pre-K establishes a solid foundation that will lead to a positive educational experience for years to come.  The goal is to create a respectful, responsible, and safe classroom and school environment where all students can learn and play together as followers of Jesus.</p>
    							<p>In the Pre-K class, God blesses the children with the gift of time: time to learn, time to play, and time to grow.  The day is tailored to excite the seeds of knowledge in the children and carefully crafted to nurture the gifts and talents that each child possesses.  Beginning literary and mathematics skills are cultivated through engaging projects done both individually and in groups and children are introduced to science, art, music, and Spanish programs through fun interactive experiences.  Finally, these individual children are brought together to form a community.  Through prayer and play, laughter and sharing, they (along with their parents) create friendships to carry them through their years at Cathedral.</p>

              <p>For our youngest students, service begins with an understanding of fellow students as children of God, who deserve respect and compassion.  Students are acknowledged and rewarded for everyday acts of service to fellow classmates and teachers.  Within the greater school community, the Pre&#45;K students are introduced to and come to understand the variety of service projects organized by higher grades through their active participation in the collection and donation of food and other needed items for charitable organizations throughout the community.  </p>

          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>God&rsquo;s creation and the appreciation of each child as a unique and special part of His Creation form the basis for every aspect of a Kindergartener&rsquo;s day.  Children learn to pray and participate in prayer in many forms:  as a class, with their 8 th Grade buddies, and as individuals.  Kindergarteners begin to learn to look beyond themselves (and toward others in God&rsquo;s creation) by serving children both in daily interactions within their classroom as well as community projects focusing on homeless children.  </p>
    			<p>As the kindergarteners leap into an all-day learning environment, the foundation for future academic success begins with a focus on the routine and expectations of a typical school day and by instilling a sense of personal responsibility to carry students through their academic career.  The fundamentals of literacy and mathematical skills are developed through varied methods including whole group, small group, and one-on-one; allowing individual students to learn and grow at their own pace.  All the while, Cathedral&rsquo;s kindergarten is a fun-filled learning space where smiles and giggles abound as children develop new friendships through play and cooperative learning. </p>

                      <h3>About</h3>
                      <p>In First Grade, children learn that they are all part of one family, God&rsquo;s Family.  The Golden Rule is paramount in behavioral management and peer relations.  The basics of Catholicism are taught and throughout the year, a commitment to service&#45;to parish, school, and community&#45;is cultivated.</p>
        							<p>First Grade builds a firm and broad foundation of literacy proficiency in Cathedral Students.  Students&rsquo; reading and writing skills are individually developed and fostered within a backdrop of different thematic curricula that engage the children throughout the year. First Grade recognizes and appreciates the uniqueness of each six- and seven&#45;year&#45;old in the class as they make the transition to a more structured academic environment and seeks to instill a sense of personal responsibility while nurturing each child&rsquo;s love of learning.</p>

                        <p>In First Grade, service takes form in an age&#45;appropriate manner to instill a sense of commitment in everyday actions by helping others.  First Graders serve the parish through monthly church clean up activities.  While tidying the pews and picking up trash, the children are also instructed on the architecture, history, and religious art within the sanctuary.  Children in First Grade serve the community along with their Fourth Grade Reading Buddies by gathering and assembling Easter Baskets of stuffed animals and candy for Cares NW, a local agency that strives to prevent child abuse and neglect.  </p>

							<h2>Second Grade</h2>
							<p>Preparation for the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy Eucharist are the centerpiece of Second Grade at Cathedral School.  Together with St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral&rsquo;s pastor and Cathedral&rsquo;s principal, the second grade teacher guides the students and their families on a year&ndash;long journey of faith as the children become more fully initiated Catholics.  </p>
							<p>Second Grade challenges its students to think on a deeper level as readers transition from learning to read, to reading to learn.  Writing skills are strengthened as these young authors begin to understand the process of crafting a piece of writing and the different forms it may take.  This enhanced level of reflection spills over into mathematics where increasingly complex strategies are coupled with tasks that require students to write to explain the steps employed in problem solving.  Throughout the year, new friendships are formed and existing ones strengthened in an atmosphere of respect, compassion, and fun both in the classroom and on the playground.</p>
						</div>
						<div id = "thirdGrade" class="noShowText">
							<h2>Third Grade</h2>
							<p>Learning to pray in many ways&ndash;in the classroom, at mass, and on one&rsquo;s own&ndash;and understanding the purpose, meaning, and symbolism of the many forms of Catholic prayer is the focus of Third Grade.  The Third Grade lives out its faith through its commitment to serving the remarkable children at Providence&rsquo;s Center for Medically Fragile Children.  </p>
							<p>Third grade is a transitional year in student learning.  As reading skills are mastered, children move from basic competence to a greater level of reading comprehension, fostering the creation of independent readers and thinkers.  In mathematics, students become proficient in multiplication and division skills setting a strong foundation in basic math facts to allow for future growth.  The joy of learning is evident in the Third Grade classroom where enthusiasm for academic success and a healthy amount of fun come together for a full and active school day.</p>
						</div>
						<div id = "fourthGrade" class="noShowText">
							<h2>Fourth Grade</h2>
							<p>Fourth Graders take a step up literally and academically at Cathedral.  As these students move to the upper floor of our school building, the Fourth Grade curriculum becomes more complex and organization and personal responsibility for completion of schoolwork is instilled in the students.  As citizens of Oregon, Fourth Graders focus on Oregon&rsquo;s geography, history, and political structure.  Carefully planned field trips throughout the state to significant sites are capped off with an overnight camp-out at the Oregon Trail where students learn first&ndash;hand how the state&rsquo;s pioneers first lived. </p>
							<p>An understanding of living as a person of Christ is made manifest through an in&ndash;depth study of the lives of saints where the Fourth Graders educate the whole school on a personally selected saint.  The Fourth Grade core curriculum builds on knowledge gained in earlier grades and moves students into an increasingly comprehensive and rigorous academic study, all the while assessing each child&rsquo;s abilities and crafting individual goals for mathematics, reading, and writing personally designed for every child to thrive. </p>
						</div>
						<div id = "fifthGrade" class="noShowText">
							<h2>Fifth Grade</h2>
							<p>Building on their firm understanding of the basic tenets of Catholicism, Fifth Graders begin to appreciate their faith on a personal level.  Through a study of the Old and New Testaments, along with the lives of the saints, Fifth Graders start to know what it means to be an active member of the Catholic Church and how, as Catholics, they are called to a vocation of service. </p>
							<p>Fifth Grade marks the final year in Cathedral&rsquo;s elementary grades before the transition to its middle school.  Fifth Grade students are tasked with an enhanced personal responsibility for their schoolwork and homework, and classroom expectations reflect an appreciation of the increasing potential of maturing students.  As confident and thoughtful readers, Fifth Graders read and analyze texts from varied genres to promote both critical thinking skills and independent thought.  In mathematics, students solidify their calculation and computation skills and broaden problem&ndash;solving skills to include the study of beginning geometry and algebra.  A broad range of topics in science and social science engage the inquisitive minds and tap into a student&rsquo;s natural curiosity of the world around them.</p>
						</div>
						<div id = "middleSchool" class="noShowText">
							<h2>Middle School</h2>
							<p>The Cathedral School Middle School serves students in grades six through eight. We welcome our students with respect for who they are and with delight in what they will bring to the world and to our school community. From our dedicated faculty, to our innovative academic, spiritual and leadership initiatives, our comprehensive middle school program is designed to inspire, nurture and support middle school students. We are focused not on exposure to content and activities for their own sake but on outputs&ndash;what students can show they have learned.  </p>
