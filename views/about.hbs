              <li class="topic"><h4 class="topic-title">Parent Participation</h4>
                <p class="list-content">Parents are active partners in the education of Cathedral students. Our parents participate in a variety of activities throughout the school.<br><br>
Our Parents Association sponsors a number of events throughout the year.
Some are community building in nature; these include our Back-to- School
Celebration, Special Friends Breakfast, and Cathedral School &amp; Parish Art Show.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="topic"><h4 class="topic-title">Service and Community</h4>
                <p class="list-content">The reward of service is intrinsic. As Catholics, our whole lives are designed to
be a dynamic relationship with the living God. God is focused outward, and when
we connect to Him we become like Him and focus outward ourselves. Service to
the community is a manifestation of this outward focus.<br><br>
All classes at Cathedral School are responsible for one service project annually.
Among our annual service projects are a volunteering at the Providence Center
for Medically Fragile Children, holding a fall food drive as well as volunteering at
the Oregon Food Bank, stuffing socks with toiletries and snacks for distribution at
the Potluck in the Park Christmas dinner, collecting Sugar and Spices for the
Blanchet House along with a Macaroni and Cheese Drive for the Portland Police
Sunshine Division, and raising funds for our sister school, St. Vincent de Paul in
Salem, Oregon.<br><br>
              In addition to celebrating Mass with the school, our pastor and parochial vicar
visit our classrooms on a regular basis. Maintaining a strong school-parish
relationship is as equally important to our clergy as it is the students and staff of
Cathedral School.<br></br>
In order to foster a school environment where all students feel connected,
comfortable, and part of an inclusive school community, all students are
members of a family group. Each family group consists of staff members as well
as students from all class levels. Family groups meet each month to participate in
community building exercises. In addition, all students are paired with a &quot;buddy&quot;
from another grade. For example, eighth grade students are paired with the
kindergarten students. Buddies sit together at Mass, have joint classroom
activities, and occasionally attend field trips together.

              <img src="images/img_about/stainedGlass.jpeg" class="featureStoryImage mediumImage picStyle " alt="stained glass window">

                <p class="featureStory">Cathedral School has served the Portland area for over 100 years.<span itempprop="founder"> Archbishop William Gross</span> established Cathedral School, originally known as St. Mary's Parochial School, in 1896. In 1900 the school was named St. Mary's Academy Annex. It was operated by the Sisters of the Holy Names at N.W. 16th and Everett.<br><br>At the time, there were 15 students enrolled in grades K-4. Beginning with the 1910-11 school year, it became known as Cathedral School. Four years later, Cathedral Parish pastor, Father Edwin O'Hara approved the building of what is now the Cathedral complex along N.W. 17th Street. This building was the site of Cathedral School for 48 years.<br><br>
                The school&rsquo;s location did not change until 1961 when the Dunne family donated their home property to Cathedral Parish for construction of the present Cathedral School. From as far back as 1910, enrollment was 179 students and reached an all-time high of 295 students in 1964. Enrollment then declined due to the changing nature of the neighborhood. This led to changes in acceptance policy during the 1970s that encouraged broader geographic and ethnic representation of students.<br><br>
                Since its founding, <span itemprop = "areaServed">Cathedral School has evolved from a parish school to a school that draws students from the Portland tri-county area as well as Clark County in Washington.</span> While many changes have taken place,<span itemprop="description"> the school's values of diversity, respect, reverence for others and belief in God have remained constant through its "Century of Excellence in Education."</span></p></span>
