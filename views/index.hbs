In 1900 the school was named St. Mary's Academy Annex. It was operated by the Sisters of the Holy Names at N.W. 16th and Everett.<br><br>At the time, there were 15 students enrolled in grades K-4. Beginning with the 1910-11 school year, it became known as Cathedral School. Four years later, Cathedral Parish pastor, Father Edwin O'Hara approved the building of what is now the Cathedral complex along N.W. 17th Street. This building was the site of Cathedral School for 48 years.<br><br>
          			The school&rsquo;s location did not change until 1961 when the Dunne family donated their home property to Cathedral Parish for construction of the present Cathedral School. From as far back as 1910, enrollment was 179 students and reached an all-time high of 295 students in 1964. Enrollment then declined due to the changing nature of the neighborhood. This led to changes in acceptance policy during the 1970s that encouraged broader geographic and ethnic representation of students.<br><br>
          			Since its founding, <span itemprop = "areaServed">Cathedral School has evolved from a parish school to a school that draws students from the Portland tri-county area as well as Clark County in Washington.</span> While many changes have taken place,<span itemprop="description"> the school's values of diversity, respect, reverence for others and belief in God have remained constant through its "Century of Excellence in Education."</span></p></span>

          <p class="featureStory">A ten-year journey of faith, knowledge, and service begins
          in Cathedral&rsquo;s Pre-Kindergarten. Pre-K establishes a
          solid foundation that will lead to a positive educational
          experience for years to come. The goal is to create a
          respectful, responsible, and safe classroom and school
          environment where all students can learn and play together as
          followers of Jesus.<br><br>
          In the Pre-K class, God blesses the children with the gift
          of time&#58; time to learn, time to play, and time to grow. The day
          is tailored to excite the seeds of knowledge in the children
          and carefully crafted to nurture the gifts and talents that
          each child possesses. Beginning literary and mathematics skills
          are cultivated through engaging projects done both individually
          and in groups and children are introduced to science, art,
          music, and Spanish programs through fun interactive
          experiences. Finally, these individual children are brought
          together to form a community. Through prayer and play, laughter
          and sharing, they (along with their parents) create friendships
          to carry them through their years at Cathedral.<br><br>
          For our youngest students, service begins with an understanding of fellow students as children of God, who deserve respect and compassion. Students are acknowledged and rewarded for everyday acts of service to fellow classmates and teachers. Within the greater school community, the Pre-K students are introduced to and come to understand the variety of service projects organized by higher grades through their active participation in the collection and donation of food and other needed items for charitable organizations throughout the community.</p>

        <h2>Kindergarten</h2>
        <p class="featureStory">God&rsquo;s creation and the appreciation of each child as a unique and special part of His Creation form the basis for every aspect of a Kindergartener&rsquo;s day. Children learn to pray and participate in prayer in many forms&#58; as a class, with their 8th Grade buddies, and as individuals. Kindergarteners begin to learn to look beyond themselves (and toward others in
        God&rsquo;s creation) by serving children both in daily interactions within their classroom as well as community projects focusing on homeless children.<br><br>
        As the kindergarteners leap into an all-day learning environment, the foundation for future academic success begins with a focus on the routine and expectations of a typical school day and by instilling a sense of personal responsibility to carry students through their academic career. The fundamentals of literacy and mathematical skills are developed through varied methods including whole group, small group, and
        one-on-one; allowing individual students to learn and grow at their own pace. All the while, Cathedral&rsquo;s kindergarten is a fun-filled learning space where smiles and giggles abound as children develop new friendships through play and cooperative learning.<br><br>
        As service is an attribute often best cultivated by example, kindergarteners work side&#45;by&#45;side with their 8th Grade Buddies on the annual Cathedral school&#45;wide sock project that benefits <a href="http://www.potluckinthepark.org/" target="_blank">Potluck in the Park.</a> The kindergarten class then, on its own, decorates and fills sacks with toys, candy, hats, and gloves for the children served by the Potluck in the Park program.</p>

        <h2>First Grade</h2>
        <p class="featureStory">In First Grade, children learn that they are all part of one family, God&rsquo;s family.  The Golden Rule is paramount in behavioral management and peer relations.  The basics of Catholicism are taught and throughout the year, a commitment to service&#58; to parish, school and community, is cultivated.<br><br>
          First Grade builds a firm and broad foundation of literacy proficiency in Cathedral Students.  Students&rsquo; reading and writing skills are individually developed and fostered within a backdrop of different thematic curricula that engage the children throughout the year. First Grade recognizes and appreciates the uniqueness of each six and seven-year-old in the class as they make the transition to a more structured academic environment and seeks to instill a sense of personal responsibility while nurturing each child&rsquo;s love of learning.<br><br>In First Grade, service takes form in an age&#45;appropriate manner to instill a sense of commitment in everyday actions by helping others. First Graders serve the parish through monthly
          church clean up activities. While tidying the pews and picking up trash, the children are also instructed on the architecture, history, and religious art within the sanctuary. Children in First Grade serve the community along with their Fourth Grade Reading Buddies by gathering and assembling Easter Baskets of stuffed animals and candy for Cares NW, a local agency that strives to prevent child abuse and neglect.</p>

        <h2>Second Grade</h2>
        <p class="featureStory">Preparation for the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy Eucharist are the centerpiece of Second Grade at Cathedral School. Together with St. Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral&rsquo;s pastor and Cathedral&rsquo;s principal, the second grade teacher guides the students and their families on a year&ndash;long
          journey of faith as the children become more fully initiated
          Catholics.<br><br>
          Second Grade challenges its students to think on a deeper level as readers transition from learning to read, to reading to learn. Writing skills are strengthened as these young authors begin to understand the process of crafting a piece of writing and the different forms it may take. This enhanced level of reflection spills over into mathematics where increasingly complex strategies are coupled with tasks that
          require students to write to explain the steps employed in problem solving. Throughout the year, new friendships are formed and existing ones strengthened in an atmosphere of respect, compassion, and fun both in the classroom and on the playground.<br><br>Together with their Sixth Grade buddies, the Second Grade
          organizes and runs &#34;Mac Attack,&#34; a macaroni and cheese
          drive for the Sunshine Division of the Portland Police Bureau.
          Collecting boxes of macaroni and cheese, Mac Attack helps
          children in need of food throughout Portland. The Second and
          Sixth Graders decorate boxes, make signs, and publicize the
          event to the school. The drive is in May, right after First
          Communion, and provides a fun and spirited way for Second
          Graders to put faith into service in a tangible and productive
          way.<br><br> Just like in First Grade, the Second Graders continue to serve the parish through monthly church clean up sessions. As they prepare for the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy Eucharist, time in the sanctuary is an opportunity to begin to understand the purpose and symbolism of the many holy objects
          within the church that relate to the sacraments.</p>

        <h2>Third Grade</h2>
        <p class="featureStory">Learning to pray in many ways&ndash;in the classroom, at
        mass, and on one&rsquo;s own&ndash;and understanding the purpose, meaning, and symbolism of the many forms of Catholic prayer is the focus of Third Grade. The Third Grade lives out its faith through its commitment to serving the remarkable
        children at Providence&rsquo;s Center for Medically Fragile Children.<br><br>
        Third grade is a transitional year in student learning. As reading skills are mastered, children move from basic competence to a greater level of reading comprehension, fostering the creation of independent readers and thinkers. In
        mathematics, students become proficient in multiplication and division skills setting a strong foundation in basic math facts to allow for future growth. The joy of learning is evident in the Third Grade classroom where enthusiasm for academic success
        and a healthy amount of fun come together for a full and active school day.<br><br>For many years, Cathedral&rsquo;s third graders have served
        Providence&rsquo;s Center for Medically Fragile Children, a
        pediatric skilled nursing facility. For many children and
        volunteer parents, this experience is transformative. Cathedral
        students visit and play with children at the center with a
        backdrop of faith—beginning and ending each volunteer session
        in prayer. Students take away from their sessions an
        understanding of all children as creations of God, an
        appreciation of the value of every person, thanksgiving for
        one’s personal health, and a greater self-awareness of their
        ability to be comfortable with children different from
        themselves. These lessons extend beyond the Providence
        volunteer times and make Third Grade time a time of great
        personal growth and maturity.<br><br>
        Back in the parish, Third Graders continue to serve St.
        Mary’s Cathedral through church clean up which couples service
        with religious education through a behind the scenes
        understanding of the sanctuary as a place of worship.</p>

        <h2>Fourth Grade</h2>
        <p class="featureStory">Fourth Graders take a step up literally and academically at
        Cathedral. As these students move to the upper floor of our
        school building, the Fourth Grade curriculum becomes more
        complex and organization and personal responsibility for
        completion of schoolwork is instilled in the students. As
        citizens of Oregon, Fourth Graders focus on Oregon&rsquo;s
        geography, history, and political structure. Carefully planned
        field trips throughout the state to significant sites are
        capped off with an overnight camp-out at the Oregon Trail where
        students learn first&ndash;hand how the state&rsquo;s pioneers
        first lived.<br><br>An understanding of living as a person of Christ is made
        manifest through an in&ndash;depth study of the lives of saints
        where the Fourth Graders educate the whole school on a
        personally selected saint. The Fourth Grade core curriculum
        builds on knowledge gained in earlier grades and moves students
        into an increasingly comprehensive and rigorous academic study,
        all the while assessing each child&rsquo;s abilities and
        crafting individual goals for mathematics, reading, and writing
        personally designed for every child to thrive.<br><br>In Fourth Grade, students begin to focus on the needs of
        fellow citizens of Oregon and donate time throughout the year
        at the Oregon Food Bank. Students and volunteer parents work
        together in groups to gather, assemble, and package food for
        needy families throughout the State. At the end of each
        volunteer session, the impact of the task is made clear through
        calculations that tell children how many meals will be prepared
        and families that will be fed by their efforts.<br><br>Within the school building, Fourth Graders have&#45;for the
        first time as Cathedral students&#45;a buddy who is younger&#58;
        every Fourth Grader is matched with a Pre-Kindergarten student.
        Together these pairs attend mass, complete special seasonal
        projects, and participate together in all school events where
        the youngest Cathedral students need a helping hand. Through
        this interaction, compassion, understanding, and empathy are
        fostered while the fourth graders relish the companionship of
        an eager, admiring four-year-old student.</p>

        <h2>Fifth Grade</h2>
        <p class="featureStory">Building on their firm understanding of the basic tenets of
        Catholicism, Fifth Graders begin to appreciate their faith on a
        personal level. Through a study of the Old and New Testaments,
        along with the lives of the saints, Fifth Graders start to know
        what it means to be an active member of the Catholic Church and
        how, as Catholics, they are called to a vocation of
        service.<br><br>Fifth Grade marks the final year in Cathedral&rsquo;s
        elementary grades before the transition to its middle school.
        Fifth Grade students are tasked with an enhanced personal
        responsibility for their schoolwork and homework, and classroom
        expectations reflect an appreciation of the increasing
        potential of maturing students. As confident and thoughtful
        readers, Fifth Graders read and analyze texts from varied
        genres to promote both critical thinking skills and independent
        thought. In mathematics, students solidify their calculation
        and computation skills and broaden problem&ndash;solving skills
        to include the study of beginning geometry and algebra. A broad
        range of topics in science and social science engage the
        inquisitive minds and tap into a student&rsquo;s natural
        curiosity of the world around them.<br><br>
        To carry out their call to service, Fifth Graders organize
        and administer the annual Thanksgiving Food Drive that benefits
        Lift Urban Portland, an interfaith network of volunteers that
        work to meet the needs of residents of Northwest and downtown
        Portland. With Cathedral School&rsquo;s location in Northwest
        Portland, students are keenly aware of those in need, as they
        are our school’s neighbors. The Fifth Grade’s efforts rally
        support for donations throughout the school that go to supply
        Lift Urban&rsquo;s food pantry and fill backpacks of nutritious
        food for children who attend the neighborhood public
        school.</p>

          <h2>Cathedral Music Program</h2>
          <p class="featureStory programStory">Music classes are closely tied with liturgical preparation. Each class is tasked with preparing and leading the school in prayer services (Prayer on Wednesday) and masses during the school year.  During music class, students select and rehearse music for the liturgies. Children in grades two through eight interested in furthering their music training and performance can participate in the Cathedral Children&rsquo;s Choir that performs at school masses and monthly parish family masses. All Cathedral students participate in the annual Christmas Program held in St.
          Mary&rsquo;s Cathedral where individual classes as well as all students together present Christmas selections culminating in a reenactment of the gospel story of Christmas complete with choral accompaniment.</p>

Children practice afterschool and perform both at bi-monthly school masses as well as the monthly Parish Family Masses.

          <h2>Cathedral Spanish Program</h2>
          <p class="featureStory programStory">Recognizing a well-rounded Catholic education includes exposure to the discipline of learning a world language, an appreciation of diverse cultures, and development of a connection between faith and language, all Cathedral students study Spanish. Children in Pre -Kindergarten through Fifth Grade attend Spanish two times per week, often in small groups. In Middle School, Spanish is part of the core curriculum and students are taught three times a week. The curriculum is tailored to each age group with each grade’s students progressively broadening their vocabulary and increasing the complexity of their language.<br><br>Communicative language use is a focus at every grade level with the youngest students learning to reply to simple questions and the middle school students engaging in full-length improvised conversations. The middle school curriculum is designed to give students a solid base in Spanish level 1 and an introduction to Spanish level 2, so that students may test out of high school level 1 if they choose.  Students who opt to study a new language in high school are well prepared with the language learning skills they have attained.<br><br>Throughout the school year, the connection between the Catholic Church and Spanish-speaking countries is explored through celebrating an annual prayer service in Spanish, honoring religious holidays important in Hispanic communities (such as the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe), and the learning and reciting of Catholic prayers in Spanish.<br><a href=" https://sites.google.com/site/maestrawalker/" target="_blank">Ms. Walker&#39;s Website</a></p>

        <p>Cathedral takes great pride in its library. In 2000, when a major expansion of the school was undertaken, putting in a state&#45;of&#45;the&#45;art&#45;albeit traditional&#45;library was of paramount importance.  The school and generous donors have continued to invest in the library keeping it up-to-date and fully stocked with books and technology to be a great resource for all students and faculty and a place of calm for the children during busy school days.</p>
        <p>
        Students in Pre-Kindergarten through Fifth Grade attend library two times per week. The librarian works in cooperation with the classroom teachers to engage the children in thoughtful curriculum that complements the focus of instruction in the classrooms. In addition, the librarian helps introduce and foster aptitude in research skills both with traditional paper resources in the library and online sources through guided direction on the proper and effective use of Internet research on iPads.</p>

        <p>Children in Fourth through Eighth Grade have the opportunity to participate in a variety of programs (for example, Battle of the Books and Lunch Bunch) that complement the literature curriculum of the classroom, provide additional opportunities for independent reading for the voracious reader, and foster a sense of academic camaraderie through teamwork and competition.</p>

          <p class="featureStory">Every Fall, in partnership with Scholastic Books, Cathedral hosts a Book Fair to both promote and generate excitement for reading and to raise funds to continue to purccathase new books for the library.

          <h3>Award Books</h3>
          <p class="featureStory">The Beverly Cleary Children&rsquo;s Choice Award is sponsored by the Oregon Association of School Libraries and is named in honor of Beverly Cleary, the beloved Oregon-born children&rsquo;s book author. The award is to encourage reading by highlighting good quality literature written on the second and third grade reading level. The contest encourages reading books that students may not otherwise find on their own and are not necessarily the popular best sellers. Cathedral&rsquo;s Second and Third Graders are encouraged to read at least four books from the list of nominated books and then are eligible to vote for their own choice. Mrs. Glenn then submits the votes on behalf of Cathedral&rsquo;s students and shares the winner once it is announced.<br><br>The Oregon Readers&rsquo;  Choice Award is co-sponsored by the Oregon Library Association along with the Oregon Reading Association and the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association. Targeted at children in Fourth Grade through high school, ORCA has two categories that Cathedral Students participate in: upper elementary school division and middle school (intermediate) division. ORCA is intended to be a fun and exciting way for young readers to become enthusiastic and discriminating readers by reading a variety of books and then voting for their favorites in a democratic process. Cathedral students in grades four through eight are eligible to vote once they have read at least four of the books from the list of nominees.</p>

        <h2>Battle of the Books</h2>
        <p class="featureStory">To enhance and complement the literature curriculum in the classrooms, the library supports many programs to challenge and nurture eager readers. Led by Cathedral&rsquo;s librarian, Cindy Glenn, Cathedral fields two Battle of the Books (BOB) teams every year: one comprised of Middle School students and one of Fourth and Fifth Graders. BOB is made possible with funds from Cathedral&rsquo;s Run 4 Cathedral annual fundraiser.<br><br>Cathedral bases its program on the model by the Oregon Association of School Libraries. Cathedral&rsquo;s teams compete against teams from other Catholic schools in two battles in the spring. The battles consist of quiz-show type questions challenging children&rsquo;s knowledge of content on sixteen selected books. All children in the selected grades are eligible for the team and to qualify, must read eight of the sixteen books and demonstrate proficiency by passing a quiz on the Accelerated Reader Program or filling out an assessment form about the books. Practices for the team are led by Mrs. Glenn at lunchtime and before school in the months leading up to the Battles. The mission of the Battle of the Books program is to encourage and recognize students who enjoy reading, promote academic excellence, and foster cooperative learning and teamwork among students.</p>

        <h3>Lunch Bunch</h3>
        <p class="featureStory">Cathedral&rsquo;s own librarian, Mrs. Glenn, has partnered with Multnomah County librarians to run voluntary book club style &ldquo;Lunch Bunches.&rdquo; Beginning in Grade Four, each month, children who sign up for Lunch Bunch read a book from a list compiled by the Multnomah County Librarian. Students bring their lunch and participate in a discussion led by Mrs. Glenn. The program highlights current award-winning children&rsquo;s books and challenges children in reading comprehension and analysis skills. Participating children enjoy reading a variety of books, including many that they would not typically select on their own.</p>
        <h3>Library Card Sign-Ups</h3>
        <p class="featureStory">Every year, Cathedral&rsquo;s kindergarten class participates in the Great Library Card Adventure, the Library&rsquo;rs annual campaign to sign up school children for library cards.

        <h3>Banned Book Week</h3>
        <p class="featureStory">Designed to coincide with Banned Book Week in late September, Cathedral School Seventh Graders are treated to a presentation from a county librarian that includes an overview of issues of censorship and an introduction to a variety of banned and challenged books. Banned Book Week celebrates the freedom to read and the presentation helps children value free and open access to information in the library.</p>
        <h3>Summer Reading Program</h3>
        <p class="featureStory">As Cathedral students prepare for summer and set goals for summer reading, Multnomah County public librarians again visit our students to share information about and preregister all students for its annual Summer Reading Program. The librarians feature books being published during the summer to create excitement for the coming months of reading.  Cathedral Students have volunteered at Multnomah County Libraries during the summer to help administer these programs and encourage fellow young readers.</p>

        <h2>Volunteer Requirements</h2>
        <p class="featureStory">Part of a commitment to and understanding of Cathedral School is the development of a partnership with the parents of all students. Parents at all levels are encouraged to be involved in the academic, social, and spiritual development of their children. Many volunteer opportunities exist to help parents be directly and indirectly involved with their children and their children&rsquo;s friends.  A parent may volunteer to be a room parent, library aid, and hot lunch--just to name a few opportunities.<br><br>Cathedral School recognizes parents as the primary educators of their children. We are committed to work in partnership with parents to engage students, develop in faith, knowledge, service, and community.  There are many easy ways for parents to get involved at Cathedral. We train, no experience required.  We need your talents in both big and little ways. Volunteering at Cathedral School is an expression of commitment to your children, your school, and your Christian faith. When a parent donates time at school, our children see the image of an adult as a giver, and they see the demonstration of one of the most poignant lessons from the Bible – humbly serving others.</p>

          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p class="featureStory">Welcome&#33;  The Cathedral Auction is our school&#39;s largest fundraiser, accounting for 8&#37; of the school&#39;s annual operating budget.  Our teachers, staff and administration are innovative and funds from this auction help to ensure that our children receive an exceptional education, grounded in Catholic principles and values and enhanced by a strong focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Science.<br><br>
          Our auction supports our students not only by raising funds but by helping to build a vibrant and loving community where our kids can thrive.  We are busy people living fast paced lives with a myriad of pressures from professional to personal.  These responsibilities sometimes make it hard to fit in much beyond a quick hello in the pickup line.  But as legendary Catholic social activist Dorothy Day so aptly stated&#58;<br><br>

          &#34;We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community.&#34;&#126;Dorothy Day<br><br>

          So we&#39;re making this year&#39;s auction not just about finances but about building strong community— a community which includes not only our immediate student families but also our parish home at St. Mary&#39;s Cathedral and the wonderful city of Portland where we are privileged to call home.  Let&#39;s model the kind of openness and inclusion that we want our children to manifest by sharing in an incredible night of community and support on March 4th&#33;<br><br>

          If you are new to Cathedral School, we are so excited to have you join us and we want you to know that if you have any questions or even any ideas big or small, that we would love to hear from you.  Head on over to the Contact section of this site and drop us a line or come say hi when you see us around campus.<br><br>

          If you are a Cathedral parent who hasn&#39;t found your &#34;place&#34; yet or not really the social gala type, we hope you&#39;ll set aside any reservations and give this year’s auction a try.  We&#39;ll be classy… sure… but with a hint of Portlandia thrown in, we aim to make sure that the evening will be fun, relaxed and a memory you&#39;ll want to make&#33;<br><br>

          If you&#39;re a Cathedral family who is so involved that some people think you’re on staff, please help us make this year&#39;s auction extra special by extending a welcome to our newer families.  We all have at least one incredibly important thing in common and that is that we love our children immensely and want them to have an excellent education.  Building authentic community will do much to make that happen.<br><br>

          Watch the Cathedral school weekly newsletter for regular updates and check back here often as we will be using the website heavily to make sure you are informed and up to date on our progress.  It&#39;s going to be amazing and we can’t wait to share it with you&#33;<br><br>
          Warmly,<br><br>

            <p>Hello Cathedral community&#33;<br><br>With the Christmas break right around the corner we would like to reach out to everyone regarding the Auction.<br><br>
            The 22nd Annual Cathedral School Auction - The Cathedral Derby - is right around the corner on March 4, 2017.  Remember to mark your calendars&#33;<br><br>
            The school is abuzz with creative projects being made in all the classrooms.  A special thank you to everyone who has helped or will soon be helping in some way with the platters and class projects.  Our leaders, Kate Gobel, Jen Keesey and Carrie Akers have done a fantastic job in coordinating so many people and making it easy for our teachers.<br><br>
            During this joyous season of giving, please consider procuring items for the Auction.  Each Cathedral family is obligated to secure at least &#36;400 in products, services or cash contributions towards our auction.  Now may be a great time to start thinking about what you want to donate.  As you shop for your loved ones, think of asking the shop owners if they'd like to donate any items.  Visit the Procurement Requirements tab below for more ideas.<br><br>
            Our website has been updated to include a fillable procurement form to make it even easier to communicate with us about what you've procured.   You can either print this form and drop it by the school office or you can save as a PDF and email it to us. Visit the link here&#58;<br><br> <a class="procurementForm" href="documents/support/procurementForm.pdf" target="_blank">Click Here For Procurement Form</a><br><br>

            We are building our incredible team of dedicated parents to lead different aspects of the Auction.

            <h4 class="newsTitles">October 21st, 2016&#58;  Class Project Volunteers Needed</h4>

            <p>Each year, some of the most exciting and competitive bidding at the live auction takes place over the class projects.  Every class at Cathedral is responsible for making a project with the help of parents.  And the making of these projects will take place in November so we need you to sign up now if you would like to help out.<br><br>
            Our Class Project chairs are Carrie Akers and Jen Keesey.<br><br>
            Project volunteers are not responsible for the cost of the projects, however, you can apply the cost of supplies towards your &#36;400 procurement requirement by filling out the auction procurement form and turning it in to the auction office. If you choose not to apply the cost towards your procurement amount and would like school to purchase the supplies, you will need to pick up the school credit card from Mrs. Hatley prior to purchasing your supplies.  Please pick this up, purchase supplies and return the credit card on the same day.<br><br>
            It is tradition that the Kindergarten class makes a quilt (we have detailed instructions on how to complete this) and the Third grade class makes a Nativity scene.  For the other grades, it is solely up to the volunteers to come up with a creative, fun project.  We have created an Auction Project Notebook that is well-organized into different project ideas to assist you.  If you need help deciding on a project, Carrie and Jen are here to help you&#33;<br><br>
            If you are interested in leading or helping with your child&#39;s class project, please email Carrie and Jen directly to let them know which class you would like to lead/help so that we can send reminders and keep you updated on the process.<br><br>

            <p>Hi there&#33;  You&#39;ve come to the right place to find out the latest and most exciting news on our 2017 Cathedral Auction.  Please check back often as we&#39;re going to keep this place bursting with updates.
            This week we&#39;d like to send a special shout out to Lane Vandeventer who used her mad graphic design skills to create the logos that you see at the top of this page.  You haven&#39;t even seen it all yet so stay tuned.  Thanks again Lane for helping us out of the starting gate with style&#21;<br><br>

            <p>If you are interested in lending a hand with the auction, big or small, please keep an eye on this website as we&#39;ll be posting lots of opportunities to help or just reach out to Kara or Wendy at our <a href="mailto:auction@cathedral-or.org">Auction Email</a> address.</p>

          <h2>Procurement Requirements</h2>
          <p class="featureStory">Every Cathedral family is required to procure or contribute at least &#36;400 in products, services or cash contributions towards our auction.  Organizations will receive a tax credit for their qualifying donation as well as recognition as a donor online and in the printed auction program.  We are updating our procurement forms and they will be available by the end of the month.  When you request a donation from a business, you will simply provide one copy to the business and turn the other copy in to the school office.<br><br>
          One final note is that your donation doesn&#39;t by any means have to be a single item totaling &#36;400.  You could do a combination of any of the below and we welcome you to do it that way because items are grouped into packages and we want to offer a range of pricepoints.<br><br><strong>Procurement forms must be turned in by Friday, January 20th</strong></p>
        </p>
          <a href="documents/support/procurementForm.pdf" target="_blank" class="standard-button second-button">Fillable Procurement Form</a>
          <ul class="centered-list">
            <li><strong>From Your Own Stash&#58;</strong><br>
              Be creative&#33;  If you have something in mind but you are not sure if it is a good fit, don&#39;t hesitate to ask. Do you have airline miles that are sitting around unused?  Do you own a vacation home or know someone who does and would be willing to donate? These are always popular items at the auction.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Requesting a Donation&#58;</strong><br>
              Consider businesses that you have a great relationship with.  Favorite nail salon, exercise studio, restaurant or hotel?  Where are you a loyal customer?   Many businesses have funds that they are willing to donate to 501C3 charitable organizations but a personal connection goes so much further than a cold call so help us reach out to our community!
            </li>
            <li><strong>Services&#58;</strong><br>
              Do you have a skill that you use professionally and would be willing to donate a package to our auction&#63; Examples from past auctions include dental work, home decorating, music lessons, sporting clinics, massage and web design.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash&#58;</strong><br>
              It&#39;s totally okay to write a check.  It costs money to put on an event like this and your cash donation really helps us cover all the costs up front so that every paddle raise at the auction is 100% profit.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="auctionText">
          <h2>Get Involved</h2>
          <p class="featureStory">
            We would love to have your help, not only because we need it but because it is a great way to get connected and get to know your fellow Cathedral Families. If you&#39;d like to volunteer but aren&#39;t sure where you would best fit please be in touch and we will match your skills, interest and available time with the perfect task.  We&#39;ll be posting lots of volunteer opportunities here and on Volgistics.  One area that is definitely good to get a jump on now if you are interested is the class projects.  Each class at Cathedral is responsible for creating an item to sell at the auction.  In past years these beautiful keepsakes have been some of the highest grossing items so it is definitely an area where your creative and organizational touch could make a huge difference.  Contact Kara or Wendy to learn more.</p>
