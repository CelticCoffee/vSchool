          <h3>Pre-Kindergarten Program</h3>
          <p>A ten-year journey of faith, knowledge, and service begins
          in Cathedral&rsquo;s Pre-Kindergarten. Pre-K establishes a
          solid foundation that will lead to a positive educational
          experience for years to come. The goal is to create a
          respectful, responsible, and safe classroom and school
          environment where all students can learn and play together as
          followers of Jesus.<br>
          In the Pre-K class, God blesses the children with the gift
          of time&#58; time to learn, time to play, and time to grow. The day
          is tailored to excite the seeds of knowledge in the children
          and carefully crafted to nurture the gifts and talents that
          each child possesses. Beginning literary and mathematics skills
          are cultivated through engaging projects done both individually
          and in groups and children are introduced to science, art,
          music, and Spanish programs through fun interactive
          experiences. Finally, these individual children are brought
          together to form a community. Through prayer and play, laughter
          and sharing, they (along with their parents) create friendships
          to carry them through their years at Cathedral.</p>

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>For our youngest students, service begins with an understanding of fellow students as children of God, who deserve respect and compassion. Students are acknowledged and rewarded for everyday acts of service to fellow classmates and teachers. Within the greater school community, the Pre-K students are introduced to and come to understand the variety of service projects organized by higher grades through their active participation in the collection and donation of food and other needed items for charitable organizations throughout the community.</p>

          <h3>Kindergarten Program</h3>
          <p>God&rsquo;s creation and the appreciation of each child as a
          unique and special part of His Creation form the basis for
          every aspect of a Kindergartener&rsquo;s day. Children learn to
          pray and participate in prayer in many forms: as a class, with
          their 8 th Grade buddies, and as individuals. Kindergarteners
          begin to learn to look beyond themselves (and toward others in
          God&rsquo;s creation) by serving children both in daily
          interactions within their classroom as well as community
          projects focusing on homeless children.</p>
          <p>As the kindergarteners leap into an all-day learning
          environment, the foundation for future academic success begins
          with a focus on the routine and expectations of a typical
          school day and by instilling a sense of personal responsibility
          to carry students through their academic career. The
          fundamentals of literacy and mathematical skills are developed
          through varied methods including whole group, small group, and
          one-on-one; allowing individual students to learn and grow at
          their own pace. All the while, Cathedral&rsquo;s kindergarten
          is a fun-filled learning space where smiles and giggles abound
          as children develop new friendships through play and
          cooperative learning.</p>

          <h3>First Grade Program</h3>
          <p>In First Grade, children learn that they are all part of one family, God&rsquo;s family.  The Golden Rule is paramount in behavioral management and peer relations.  The basics of Catholicism are taught and throughout the year, a commitment to service&#58; to parish, school and community, is cultivated.<br><br>
            First Grade builds a firm and broad foundation of literacy proficiency in Cathedral Students.  Students&rsquo; reading and writing skills are individually developed and fostered within a backdrop of different thematic curricula that engage the children throughout the year. First Grade recognizes and appreciates the uniqueness of each six and seven-year-old in the class as they make the transition to a more structured academic environment and seeks to instill a sense of personal responsibility while nurturing each child&rsquo;s love of learning.

            manner to instill a sense of commitment in everyday actions by
            helping others. First Graders serve the parish through monthly
            church clean up activities. While tidying the pews and picking
            up trash, the children are also instructed on the architecture,
            history, and religious art within the sanctuary. Children in
            First Grade serve the community along with their Fourth Grade
            Reading Buddies by gathering and assembling Easter Baskets of
            stuffed animals and candy for Cares NW, a local agency that
            strives to prevent child abuse and neglect.</p>

          guides the students and their families on a year&ndash;long
          journey of faith as the children become more fully initiated
          Catholics.<br><br>
          Second Grade challenges its students to think on a deeper
          level as readers transition from learning to read, to reading
          to learn. Writing skills are strengthened as these young
          authors begin to understand the process of crafting a piece of
          writing and the different forms it may take. This enhanced
          level of reflection spills over into mathematics where
          increasingly complex strategies are coupled with tasks that
          require students to write to explain the steps employed in
          problem solving. Throughout the year, new friendships are
          formed and existing ones strengthened in an atmosphere of
          respect, compassion, and fun both in the classroom and on the
          playground.</p>

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>Together with their Sixth Grade buddies, the Second Grade
            organizes and runs &#34;Mac Attack,&#34; a macaroni and cheese
            drive for the Sunshine Division of the Portland Police Bureau.
            Collecting boxes of macaroni and cheese, Mac Attack helps
            children in need of food throughout Portland. The Second and
            Sixth Graders decorate boxes, make signs, and publicize the
            event to the school. The drive is in May, right after First
            Communion, and provides a fun and spirited way for Second
            Graders to put faith into service in a tangible and productive
            way.</p>
            <p>Just like in First Grade, the Second Graders continue to
            serve the parish through monthly church clean up sessions. As
            they prepare for the Sacraments of Reconciliation and Holy
            Eucharist, time in the sanctuary is an opportunity to begin to
            understand the purpose and symbolism of the many holy objects
            within the church that relate to the sacraments.</p>

          <p>Learning to pray in many ways&ndash;in the classroom, at
          mass, and on one&rsquo;s own&ndash;and understanding the
          purpose, meaning, and symbolism of the many forms of Catholic

          children at Providence&rsquo;s Center for Medically Fragile
          Children.</p>
          <p>Third grade is a transitional year in student learning. As
          reading skills are mastered, children move from basic
          competence to a greater level of reading comprehension,
          fostering the creation of independent readers and thinkers. In
          mathematics, students become proficient in multiplication and
          division skills setting a strong foundation in basic math facts
          to allow for future growth. The joy of learning is evident in
          the Third Grade classroom where enthusiasm for academic success
          and a healthy amount of fun come together for a full and active
          school day.</p>

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>For many years, Cathedral&rsquo;s third graders have served
            Providence&rsquo;s Center for Medically Fragile Children, a
            pediatric skilled nursing facility. For many children and
            volunteer parents, this experience is transformative. Cathedral
            students visit and play with children at the center with a
            backdrop of faith—beginning and ending each volunteer session
            in prayer. Students take away from their sessions an
            understanding of all children as creations of God, an
            appreciation of the value of every person, thanksgiving for
            one’s personal health, and a greater self-awareness of their
            ability to be comfortable with children different from
            themselves. These lessons extend beyond the Providence
            volunteer times and make Third Grade time a time of great
            personal growth and maturity.</p>
            <p>Back in the parish, Third Graders continue to serve St.
            Mary’s Cathedral through church clean up which couples service
            with religious education through a behind the scenes
            understanding of the sanctuary as a place of worship.</p>

          <h3>Fourth Grade Program</h3>
          <p>Fourth Graders take a step up literally and academically at
          Cathedral. As these students move to the upper floor of our
          school building, the Fourth Grade curriculum becomes more
          complex and organization and personal responsibility for
          completion of schoolwork is instilled in the students. As
          citizens of Oregon, Fourth Graders focus on Oregon&rsquo;s
          geography, history, and political structure. Carefully planned
          field trips throughout the state to significant sites are
          capped off with an overnight camp-out at the Oregon Trail where
          students learn first&ndash;hand how the state&rsquo;s pioneers
          first lived.</p>
          <p>An understanding of living as a person of Christ is made
          manifest through an in&ndash;depth study of the lives of saints
          where the Fourth Graders educate the whole school on a
          personally selected saint. The Fourth Grade core curriculum
          builds on knowledge gained in earlier grades and moves students
          into an increasingly comprehensive and rigorous academic study,
          all the while assessing each child&rsquo;s abilities and
          crafting individual goals for mathematics, reading, and writing
          personally designed for every child to thrive.</p>

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>In Fourth Grade, students begin to focus on the needs of
            fellow citizens of Oregon and donate time throughout the year
            at the Oregon Food Bank. Students and volunteer parents work
            together in groups to gather, assemble, and package food for
            needy families throughout the State. At the end of each
            volunteer session, the impact of the task is made clear through
            calculations that tell children how many meals will be prepared
            and families that will be fed by their efforts.</p>
            <p>Within the school building, Fourth Graders have&#45;for the
            first time as Cathedral students&#45;a buddy who is younger:
            every Fourth Grader is matched with a Pre-Kindergarten student.
            Together these pairs attend mass, complete special seasonal
            projects, and participate together in all school events where
            the youngest Cathedral students need a helping hand. Through
            this interaction, compassion, understanding, and empathy are
            fostered while the fourth graders relish the companionship of
            an eager, admiring four-year-old student. .</p>

          <h3>Fifth Grade Program</h3>
          <p>Building on their firm understanding of the basic tenets of
          Catholicism, Fifth Graders begin to appreciate their faith on a
          personal level. Through a study of the Old and New Testaments,
          along with the lives of the saints, Fifth Graders start to know
          what it means to be an active member of the Catholic Church and
          how, as Catholics, they are called to a vocation of
          service.</p>
          <p>Fifth Grade marks the final year in Cathedral&rsquo;s
          elementary grades before the transition to its middle school.
          Fifth Grade students are tasked with an enhanced personal
          responsibility for their schoolwork and homework, and classroom
          expectations reflect an appreciation of the increasing
          potential of maturing students. As confident and thoughtful
          readers, Fifth Graders read and analyze texts from varied
          genres to promote both critical thinking skills and independent
          thought. In mathematics, students solidify their calculation
          and computation skills and broaden problem&ndash;solving skills
          to include the study of beginning geometry and algebra. A broad
          range of topics in science and social science engage the
          inquisitive minds and tap into a student&rsquo;s natural
          curiosity of the world around them.</p>

            <h3>Service</h3>
            <p>To carry out their call to service, Fifth Graders organize
            and administer the annual Thanksgiving Food Drive that benefits
            Lift Urban Portland, an interfaith network of volunteers that
            work to meet the needs of residents of Northwest and downtown
            Portland. With Cathedral School&rsquo;s location in Northwest
            Portland, students are keenly aware of those in need, as they
            are our school’s neighbors. The Fifth Grade’s efforts rally
            support for donations throughout the school that go to supply
            Lift Urban&rsquo;s food pantry and fill backpacks of nutritious
            food for children who attend the neighborhood public
            school.</p>

Miss Hart has the background and experience needed to teach all 5th grade subject areas, especially math and language arts.  She understands the importance of intentional assessment driven instruction and implements lessons that are engaging to all students. Mr. Jim Makey, St. Columbkille Principal stated &#34;Her students achieve at a high level. She keeps kids on-task from the moment they walk into the room until the class period ends. Her classroom management skills are excellent. She scaffolds her lessons incrementally so the students are able to achieve the objectives. I am consistently impressed with her professionalism, organization and dedication to her students and our school.&#34;

          <p>The Cathedral School Middle School serves students in grades
          six through eight. We welcome our students with respect for who
          they are and with delight in what they will bring to the world
          and to our school community. From our dedicated faculty, to our
          innovative academic, spiritual and leadership initiatives, our
          comprehensive middle school program is designed to inspire,
          nurture and support middle school students. We are focused not
          on exposure to content and activities for their own sake but on
          outputs&ndash;what students can show they have learned.</p>
