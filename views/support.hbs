                Welcome&#33;  The Cathedral Auction is our school&#39;s largest fundraiser, accounting for 8&#37; of the school&#39;s annual operating budget.  Our teachers, staff and administration are innovative and funds from this auction help to ensure that our children receive an exceptional education, grounded in Catholic principles and values and enhanced by a strong focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Science.<br><br>
                Our auction supports our students not only by raising funds but by helping to build a vibrant and loving community where our kids can thrive.  We are busy people living fast paced lives with a myriad of pressures from professional to personal.  These responsibilities sometimes make it hard to fit in much beyond a quick hello in the pickup line.  But as legendary Catholic social activist Dorothy Day so aptly stated&#58;<br><br>

                &#34;We have all known the long loneliness and we have learned that the only solution is love and that love comes with community.&#34;&#126;Dorothy Day<br><br>

                So we&#39;re making this year&#39;s auction not just about finances but about building strong community— a community which includes not only our immediate student families but also our parish home at St. Mary&#39;s Cathedral and the wonderful city of Portland where we are privileged to call home.  Let&#39;s model the kind of openness and inclusion that we want our children to manifest by sharing in an incredible night of community and support on March 4th&#33;<br><br>

                If you are new to Cathedral School, we are so excited to have you join us and we want you to know that if you have any questions or even any ideas big or small, that we would love to hear from you.  Head on over to the Contact section of this site and drop us a line or come say hi when you see us around campus.<br><br>

                If you are a Cathedral parent who hasn&#39;t found your &#34;place&#34; yet or not really the social gala type, we hope you&#39;ll set aside any reservations and give this year’s auction a try.  We&#39;ll be classy… sure… but with a hint of Portlandia thrown in, we aim to make sure that the evening will be fun, relaxed and a memory you&#39;ll want to make&#33;<br><br>

                If you&#39;re a Cathedral family who is so involved that some people think you’re on staff, please help us make this year&#39;s auction extra special by extending a welcome to our newer families.  We all have at least one incredibly important thing in common and that is that we love our children immensely and want them to have an excellent education.  Building authentic community will do much to make that happen.<br><br>

                Watch the Cathedral school weekly newsletter for regular updates and check back here often as we will be using the website heavily to make sure you are informed and up to date on our progress.  It&#39;s going to be amazing and we can’t wait to share it with you&#33;<br><br>

                Warmly,<br><br>

                Wendy Goodwin and Kara Vargo<br>

                <h4 class="newsTitles">October 21st, 2016&#58;  Class Project Volunteers Needed</h4>

                <p>Each year, some of the most exciting and competitive bidding at the live auction takes place over the class projects.  Every class at Cathedral is responsible for making a project with the help of parents.  And the making of these projects will take place in November so we need you to sign up now if you would like to help out.<br><br>
                Our Class Project chairs are Carrie Akers and Jen Keesey.<br><br>
                Project volunteers are not responsible for the cost of the projects, however, you can apply the cost of supplies towards your &#36;400 procurement requirement by filling out the auction procurement form and turning it in to the auction office. If you choose not to apply the cost towards your procurement amount and would like school to purchase the supplies, you will need to pick up the school credit card from Mrs. Hatley prior to purchasing your supplies.  Please pick this up, purchase supplies and return the credit card on the same day.<br><br>
                It is tradition that the Kindergarten class makes a quilt (we have detailed instructions on how to complete this) and the Third grade class makes a Nativity scene.  For the other grades, it is solely up to the volunteers to come up with a creative, fun project.  We have created an Auction Project Notebook that is well-organized into different project ideas to assist you.  If you need help deciding on a project, Carrie and Jen are here to help you&#33;<br><br>
                If you are interested in leading or helping with your child&#39;s class project, please email Carrie and Jen directly to let them know which class you would like to lead/help so that we can send reminders and keep you updated on the process.<br><br>
                <ul>
                  <li>Carrie Akers&#58; carrieakers[@]hotmail[.]com</li>

                Thank you and thanks so much to Carrie and Jen for taking on this wonderful committee&#33;!</p>

                <h4>Procurement Forms...</h4>
                <p>Procurement forms are coming SOON&#33; Thank you to those of you who have already reached out regarding your ideas for donations and procurement.  We can tell it&#39;s going to be an amazing year.</p>

                <p>Hi there&#33;  You&#39;ve come to the right place to find out the latest and most exciting news on our 2017 Cathedral Auction.  Please check back often as we&#39;re going to keep this place bursting with updates.
                This week we&#39;d like to send a special shout out to Lane Vandeventer who used her mad graphic design skills to create the logos that you see at the top of this page.  You haven&#39;t even seen it all yet so stay tuned.  Thanks again Lane for helping us out of the starting gate with style&#21;<br><br>

                <p>If you are interested in lending a hand with the auction, big or small, please keep an eye on this website as we&#39;ll be posting lots of opportunities to help or just reach out to Kara or Wendy at our <a href="mailto:auction@cathedral-or.org">Auction Email</a> address.</p>


              </div>
            <div class="auctionText" id="procurementText">
              <p class="procureIntro">Every Cathedral family is required to procure or contribute at least &#36;400 in products, services or cash contributions towards our auction.  Organizations will receive a tax credit for their qualifying donation as well as recognition as a donor online and in the printed auction program.  We are updating our procurement forms and they will be available by the end of the month.  When you request a donation from a business, you will simply provide one copy to the business and turn the other copy in to the school office.<br><br>
              One final note is that your donation doesn&#39;t by any means have to be a single item totaling &#36;400.  You could do a combination of any of the below and we welcome you to do it that way because items are grouped into packages and we want to offer a range of pricepoints.</p>

              <ul class="newsList">
                <li><strong>From Your Own Stash&#58;</strong><br>
                  Be creative&#33;  If you have something in mind but you are not sure if it is a good fit, don&#39;t hesitate to ask. Do you have airline miles that are sitting around unused?  Do you own a vacation home or know someone who does and would be willing to donate? These are always popular items at the auction.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Requesting a Donation&#58;</strong><br>
                  Consider businesses that you have a great relationship with.  Favorite nail salon, exercise studio, restaurant or hotel?  Where are you a loyal customer?   Many businesses have funds that they are willing to donate to 501C3 charitable organizations but a personal connection goes so much further than a cold call so help us reach out to our community!
                </li>
                <li><strong>Services&#58;</strong><br>
                  Do you have a skill that you use professionally and would be willing to donate a package to our auction&#63; Examples from past auctions include dental work, home decorating, music lessons, sporting clinics, massage and web design.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash&#58;</strong><br>
                  It&#39;s totally okay to write a check.  It costs money to put on an event like this and your cash donation really helps us cover all the costs up front so that every paddle raise at the auction is 100% profit.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              <p class="auctionText" id="getInvolvedText">
                We would love to have your help, not only because we need it but because it is a great way to get connected and get to know your fellow Cathedral Families. If you&#39;d like to volunteer but aren&#39;t sure where you would best fit please be in touch and we will match your skills, interest and available time with the perfect task.  We&#39;ll be posting lots of volunteer opportunities here and on Volgistics.  One area that is definitely good to get a jump on now if you are interested is the class projects.  Each class at Cathedral is responsible for creating an item to sell at the auction.  In past years these beautiful keepsakes have been some of the highest grossing items so it is definitely an area where your creative and organizational touch could make a huge difference.  Contact Kara or Wendy to learn more.

            <p>Run 4 Cathedral, our 2nd largest fundraiser, is an annual jog-a-thon in which Cathedral School students participate to raise funds for enhancements to the school curriculum that would not be able to be funded through the school’s operating budget. A major portion of the proceeds raised provides the funding for the school’s 20 hour per week art program, in partnership with the Oregon College of Art and Craft. In addition, Run 4 Cathedral provides a portion of the funds for students to participate in Outdoor School and the Oregon Trail Overnight, and fully funds all field trips, in-class presentations, assemblies, student retreats, as well as other curriculum enhancements.</p>

              <p>Cathedral School is beginning a “Legacy and Faith Program” to encourage alumni, parents and other friends to make a lasting gift for future generations of Cathedral School.<br>
              &#34;Legacy&#34; gifts are bequests or estate designations in your will, trust, life insurance or retirement plan to benefit Cathedral School.  They are placed into the Cathedral School Endowment where they are preserved and the earnings are used for the ongoing support of students needing financial aid, maintaining excellent academic programs, and retaining the very best teachers.<br><br>
              &#34;The greatest need we have is to provide financial aid for students and families who cannot afford to pay tuition,&#34; said Amy Biggs, principal.  This past school year, 42 students, or 18 percent of the student body, received &#36;95,500 in financial aid.  &#34;Catholic education is a value and we want to be there for those students and families who otherwise would not be able to benefit from a Catholic education,&#34; she said.<br><br>
              A legacy gift speaks to the people you love and who matter most to you.  Think of children from families who desire a Catholic education, but can’t afford to pay.  The gift of an excellent Catholic education lasts for a lifetime.  Make that gift possible with your legacy provision.<br><br>
              There are many ways to structure a legacy gift.  It can be a fixed amount of money or a bequest of a specific item of property, such as a house.  Another way is to leave a residuary gift in your estate.  That involves leaving a percentage of the remaining value of your estate after all other bequests have been made.<br>
              Consult your estate-planning advisor to make sure your legacy plan expresses love for those who are most important to you.  We hope you will include Cathedral students among those who you love and want to remember.  To include Cathedral School in your legacy planning, our legal name is:  Cathedral Church, Portland Oregon.  Tax ID &#35;93-0978500.  Please contact our principal, <a href="mailto:abiggs@cathedral-or.org">Mrs. Amy Biggs</a> regarding your legacy plans.</p>
