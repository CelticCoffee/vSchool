          <h2>Run For Cathedral</h2>
          <p class="featureStory">Run 4 Cathedral, our 2nd largest fundraiser, is an annual jog-a-thon in which Cathedral School students participate to raise funds for enhancements to the school curriculum that would not be able to be funded through the school’s operating budget. A major portion of the proceeds raised provides the funding for the school’s 20 hour per week art program, in partnership with the Oregon College of Art and Craft. In addition, Run 4 Cathedral provides a portion of the funds for students to participate in Outdoor School and the Oregon Trail Overnight, and fully funds all field trips, in-class presentations, assemblies, student retreats, as well as other curriculum enhancements.</p>

          <h2>Leave a Legacy</h2>
          <p class="featureStory"><p>Cathedral School is beginning a “Legacy and Faith Program” to encourage alumni, parents and other friends to make a lasting gift for future generations of Cathedral School.<br>
          &#34;Legacy&#34; gifts are bequests or estate designations in your will, trust, life insurance or retirement plan to benefit Cathedral School.  They are placed into the Cathedral School Endowment where they are preserved and the earnings are used for the ongoing support of students needing financial aid, maintaining excellent academic programs, and retaining the very best teachers.<br><br>
          &#34;The greatest need we have is to provide financial aid for students and families who cannot afford to pay tuition,&#34; said Amy Biggs, principal.  This past school year, 42 students, or 18 percent of the student body, received &#36;95,500 in financial aid.  &#34;Catholic education is a value and we want to be there for those students and families who otherwise would not be able to benefit from a Catholic education,&#34; she said.<br><br>
          A legacy gift speaks to the people you love and who matter most to you.  Think of children from families who desire a Catholic education, but can’t afford to pay.  The gift of an excellent Catholic education lasts for a lifetime.  Make that gift possible with your legacy provision.<br><br>
          There are many ways to structure a legacy gift.  It can be a fixed amount of money or a bequest of a specific item of property, such as a house.  Another way is to leave a residuary gift in your estate.  That involves leaving a percentage of the remaining value of your estate after all other bequests have been made.<br>
          Consult your estate-planning advisor to make sure your legacy plan expresses love for those who are most important to you.  We hope you will include Cathedral students among those who you love and want to remember.  To include Cathedral School in your legacy planning, our legal name is:  Cathedral Church, Portland Oregon.  Tax ID &#35;93-0978500.  Please contact our principal, <a href="mailto:abiggs@cathedral-or.org">Mrs. Amy Biggs</a> regarding your legacy plans.</p>

          <h2>The Cathedral School Annual Auction</h2>
          <p class="featureStory">The Cathedral Auction is our school&#39;s largest fundraiser, accounting for 10&#37; of the school&#39;s annual operating budget.  Our teachers, staff and administration are innovative and funds from this auction help to ensure that our children receive an exceptional education, grounded in Catholic principles and values and enhanced by a strong focus on Science, Technology, and Engineering.<br><br>
          Our auction supports our students not only by raising funds but by helping to build a vibrant and loving community where our kids can thrive. <br><br>We would like to thank the numerous generous supporters--both individuals and local businesses who helped to make the 2017 Cathedral Derby Auction a success.<br><br>
          You can still donate to our 2017 Paddle Raise, Project Safe Play and if you are a current Cathedral family, there are still a few Easel Parties to add your name to.  To make your donation or register for a party, click the links below.
