Cathedral School in Portland Oregon currently has an outstanding technology program.

For three years running they have been an Apple Distinguished School and their teachers are nationally recognized in STEM.

I started an overhaul of the site simultaneously with beginning my training at Portland Code School in JavaScript immersion.

The new site focuses on:

1.  Responsive Design
2.  Fluid user experience-- including integration of social media.
3.  Tidying up the code behind the scene-- resizing images, etc. to allow for faster/better load across multiple browser platforms
4.  soon... applications to ease in parent/administration communication.
