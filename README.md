Cathedral School in Portland Oregon currently has an outstanding technology program.

For three years running they have been an Apple Distinguished School and their teachers are nationally recognized in STEM.

The current website however does not reflect the school's focus in this area. (http://cathedral-or.org/)

I started an overhaul of the site simultaneously with beginning my training at Portland Code School in JavaScript immersion.

The new site will focus on:

Responsive Design
Fluid user experience-- including integration of social media.
Tidying up the code behind the scene-- resizing images, etc. to allow for faster/better load across multiple browser platforms
soon... applications to ease in parent/administration communication.
The site is unlike many websites because there is SO much information that the administration and advisory council wishes to convey. It cannot by its nature be the sleek, minimalistic web experience that many of us enjoy. However, I believe that the direction of the new site will vastly improve the current experience and lower the work load of the staff that will maintain it on a day to day basis.

The site undergoes constant review from staff and council as they continue to define their desired outcome. Our target release is Christmas 2015.
